If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can't be held or carried by an unwilling creature. The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls d100 and consults the table.","","Familiarity - Mishap - Similar Area - Off Target - On Target","Permanent Circle - x - x - x - 01-100","Associated Object - x - x - x - 01-100","Very Familiar - 01-05 - 06-13 - 14-24 - 25-100","Seen Casually - 01-33 - 34-43 - 44-53 - 54-100","Viewed Once - 01-43 - 44-53 - 54-73 - 74-100","Description - 01-43 - 44-53 - 54-73 - 74-100","False Description - 01-50 - 51-100 - x - x","","Familiarity: \"Permanent Circle\" means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. \"Associated Object\" means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard's library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a Lich's secret tomb.","","\"Very Familiar\" is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. \"Seen Casually\" is some place you have seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar. \"Viewed Once\" is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. \"Description\" is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a map.","","\"False Description\" is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.","","On Target: You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to go.","","Off Target: You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 x 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be travelled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as north-east, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.","","Similar Area: You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.","","Mishap: The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time)."]},{"name":"Teleportation Circle","level":"5","school":"C","time":"1 minute","range":"10 feet","components":"V, M (rare chalks and inks infused with precious gems with 50 gp, which the spell consumes)","duration":"1 round","classes":"Bard, Cleric (Arcana), Sorcerer, Wizard","text":["As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you.

Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice.","","• You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item.

You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.","","You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples.

This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.","","The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days.
