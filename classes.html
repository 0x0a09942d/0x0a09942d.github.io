Using a discipline requires no spoken words, gestures, or materials. The power of psionics comes from the mind.","Duration","An option in a discipline specifies how long its effect lasts. Instantaneous: If no duration is specified, the effect of an option is instantaneous. Concentration: Some effect options require concentration. This requirement is noted with a “C” after the option’s psi point cost.","Concentrating on a discipline follows the same rules as concentrating on a spell. This rule means you can’t concentrate on a spell and a discipline at the same time, nor can you concentrate on two disciplines at the same time.","Targets and Areas of Effect","Psionic disciplines use the same rules as spells for determining targets and areas of effect. See chapter 10, “Spellcasting,” of the Player’s Handbook.","Saving Throws and Attack Rolls","If a discipline requires a saving throw, it specifies the type of save and the results of a successful or failed saving throw.
