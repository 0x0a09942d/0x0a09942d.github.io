Thus, he set out to forge a weapon that would be such a symbol.</text><text>Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved, the young prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of Moradin, the dwarven god of creation, he first crafted four great tools: the Brutal Pick, the Earthheart Forge, the Anvil of Songs, and the Shaping Hammer. With them, he forged the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords.</text><text>Armed with the artifact, the prince returned to the dwarf clans and brought peace. His axe ended grudges and answered slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many generations.</text><text>Later, in a dark era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it.</text><text>Magic Weapon: The Axe of the Dwarvish Lords is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The axe also functions as a belt of dwarvenkind, a dwarven thrower, and a sword of sharpness.</text><text>Random Properties: The axe has the following randomly determined properties: </text><text>• 2 minor beneficial properties</text><text>• 1 major beneficial property</text><text>• 2 minor detrimental properties</text><text>Blessings of Moradin: If you are a dwarf attuned to the axe, you gain the following benefits: </text><text>• You have immunity to poison damage.</text><text>• The range of your darkvision increases by 60 feet.</text><text>• You gain proficiency with artisan\'s tools related to blacksmithing, brewing, and stonemasonry.</text><text>Conjure Earth Elemental: If you are holding the axe, you can use your action to cast the conjure elemental spell from it, summoning an earth elemental. You can\'t use this property again until the next dawn.</text><text>Travel the Depths: You can use an action to touch the axe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast the teleport spell from the axe. If your intended destination is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or arriving somewhere unexpected. You can\'t use this property again until 3 days have passed.</text><text>Curse: The axe bears a curse that affects any non-dwarf that becomes attuned to it. Even if the attunement ends, the curse remains. With each passing day, the creature\'s physical appearance and stature become more dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf. The physical changes wrought by the axe aren\'t considered magical in nature (and therefore can\'t be dispelled), but they can be undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a greater restoration or remove curse spell.</text><text>Destroying the Axe: The only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the Earthheart Forge, where it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for fifty years before it finally succumbs to the fire and is consumed.</text><text /><text>Source: Dungeon Master\'s Guide, page 221</text><modifier category="bonus">melee attacks +3</modifier><modifier category="bonus">melee damage +3</modifier></item><item><name>Backpack</name><type>G</type><value>2gp</value><weight>5</weight><text>A backpack can hold one cubic foot or 30 pounds of gear.

Each creature in the area, including you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren\'t being worn or carried.</text><text>If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The DM can choose an effect from the following table, determine it randomly, or create an effect.</text><text /><text>d100 — Effect: </text><text>01 — 5d4 toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a toadstool, roll any die. On an odd roll, the eater must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take Sd6 poison damage and become poisoned for 1 hour. On an even roll, the eater gains 5d6 temporary hit points for 1 hour.</text><text>2-10 — A geyser erupts and spouts water, beer, berry juice, tea, vinegar, wine, or oil (DM\'s choice) 30 feet into the air for 1d12 rounds.</text><text>11-20 — A treant sprouts (see the Monster Manual for statistics). There\'s a 50 percent chance that the treant is chaotic evil and attacks.</text><text>21-30 — An animate, immobile stone statue in your likeness rises. It makes verbal threats against you. If you leave it and others come near, it describes you as the most heinous of villains and directs the newcomers to find and attack you. If you are on the same plane of existence as the statue, it knows where you are. The statue becomes inanimate after 24 hours.</text><text>31-40 — A campfire with blue flames springs forth and burns for 24 hours (or until it is extinguished).</text><text>41-50 — 1d6 + 6 shriekers sprout (see the Monster Manual for statistics).</text><text>51-60 — 1d4 + 8 bright pink toads crawl forth. Whenever a toad is touched, it transforms into a Large or smaller monster of the DM\'s choice. The monster remains for 1 minute, then disappears in a puff of bright pink smoke.</text><text>61-70 — A hungry bulette (see the Monster Manual for statistics) burrows up and attacks.</text><text>71-80 A fruit tree grows. It has 1d10+20 fruit, 1d8 of which act as randomly determined magic potions, while one acts as an ingested poison of the DM\'s choice. The tree vanishes after 1 hour.

On a successful save, a creature permanently increases its lowest ability score by 1, randomly choosing among equally low scores. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 force damage from an internal magical explosion.</text><text>91-99 — A pyramid with a 60-foot-square base bursts upward.

Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn\'t pulled inside the bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.</text><text>Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The DM determines the time and plane.</text><text>If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.</text><text /><text>Source: Dungeon Master\'s Guide, page 153</text></item><item><name>Bag of Holding</name><type>W</type><weight>15</weight><rarity>Uncommon</rarity><text>Rarity: Uncommon</text><text>This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep.

Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.</text><text>If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.</text><text>Placing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional space created by a Heward\'s handy haversack, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes.

A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage disappears in a blinding flash and is destroyed, leaving its possessions behind.</text><text>Benefits granted by the Book of Exalted Deeds last only as long as you strive to do good. If you fail to perform at least one act of kindness or generosity within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform an evil act, you lose all the benefits granted by the book.</text><text>Random Properties: The Book of Exalted Deeds has the following random properties: </text><text>• 2 minor beneficial properties</text><text>• 2 major beneficial properties</text><text>Increased Wisdom: After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. You can\'t gain this benefit from the book more than once.</text><text>Enlightened Magic: Once you\'ve read and studied the book, any spell slot you expend to cast a cleric or paladin spell counts as a spell slot of one level higher.</text><text>Halo: Once you\'ve read and studied the book, you gain a protective halo. This halo sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can dismiss or manifest the halo as a bonus action. While present, the halo gives you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with good creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with evil creatures. In addition, fiends and undead within the halo\'s bright light make attack rolls against you with disadvantage.</text><text>Destroying the Book: It is rumored that the Book of Exalted Deeds can\'t be destroyed as long as good exists in the multiverse. However, drowning the book in the River Styx removes all writing and imagery from its pages and renders the book powerless for 1d100 years.</text><text /><text>Source: Dungeon Master\'s Guide, page 222</text><modifier category="ability score">wisdom +2</modifier></item><item><name>Book of Vile Darkness</name><type>W</type><weight>5</weight><rarity>Artifact</rarity><text>Rarity: Artifact</text><text>Requires attunement</text><text /><text>	The contents of this foul manuscript of ineffable wickedness are the meat and drink of those in evil\'s thrall. No mortal was meant to know the secrets it contains, knowledge so horrid that to even glimpse the scrawled pages invites madness.</text><text>Most believe the lich-god Vecna authored the Book of Vile Darkness. He recorded in its pages every diseased idea, every unhinged thought, and every example of blackest magic he came across or devised. Vecna covered every vile topic he could, making the book a gruesome catalog of all mortal wrongs.</text><text>Other practitioners of evil have held the book and added their own input to its catalog of vile knowledge. Their additions are clear, for the writers of later works stitched whatever they were writing into the tome or, in some cases, made notations and additions to existing text. There are places where pages are missing, torn. or covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches that the original text can\'t be divined.</text><text>Nature can\'t abide the book\'s presence. Ordinary plants wither in its presence, animals are unwilling to approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if the book rests on it long enough.</text><text>A creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours reading and studying it to digest its contents and reap its benefits. The creature can then freely modify the book\'s contents, provided that those modifications advance evil and expand the lore already contained within.</text><text>Whenever a non-evil creature attunes to the Book of Vile Darkness, that creature must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature\'s alignment changes to neutral evil.</text><text>The Book of Vile Darkness remains with you only as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you fail to perform at least one evil act within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the book disappears. If you die while attuned to the book, an entity of great evil claims your soul. You can\'t be restored to life by any means while your soul remains imprisoned.</text><text>Random Properties: The Book of Vile Darkness has the following random properties: </text><text>• 3 minor beneficial properties</text><text>• 1 major beneficial property</text><text>• 3 minor detrimental properties</text><text>• 2 major detrimental properties</text><text>Adjusted Ability Scores: After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, one ability score of your choice increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. Another ability score of your choice decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can\'t adjust your ability scores again.</text><text>Mark of Darkness: After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, you acquire a physical disfigurement as a hideous sign of your devotion to vile darkness. An evil rune might appear on your face, your eyes might become glossy black, or horns might sprout from your forehead. Or you might become wizened and hideous, lose all facial features, gain a forked tongue, or some other feature the DM chooses. The mark of darkness grants you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with evil creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with non-evil creatures.</text><text>Command Evil: While you are attuned to the book and holding it, you can use an action to cast the dominate monster spell on an evil target (save DC 18). You can\'t use this property again until the next dawn.</text><text>Dark Lore: You can reference the Book of Vile Darkness whenever you make an Intelligence check to recall information about some aspect of evil, such as lore about demons. When you do so, double your proficiency bonus on that check.</text><text>Dark Speech: While you carry the Book of Vile Darkness and are attuned to it, you can use an action to recite word from its pages in a foul language known as Dark Speech. Each time you do so, you take 1d12 psychic damage, and each non-evil creature within 15 feet of you takes 3d6 psychic damage.</text><text>Destroying the Book: The Book of Vile Darkness allows pages to be torn from it, but any evil lore contained on those pages finds its way back into the book eventually, usually when a new author adds pages to the tome.</text><text>If a solar tears the book in two, the book is destroyed for 1d100 years, after which it reforms in some dark corner of the multiverse.</text><text>A creature attuned to the book for one hundred years can unearth a phrase hidden in the original text that, when translated to Celestial and spoken aloud, destroys both the speaker and the book in a blinding flash of radiance. However, as long as evil exists in the multiverse, the book reforms 1d10 x 100 years later.</text><text>If all evil in the multiverse is wiped out, the book turns to dust and is forever destroyed.</text><text /><text>Source: Dungeon Master\'s Guide, page 222</text></item><item><name>Boots of Elvenkind</name><type>W</type><rarity>Uncommon</rarity><text>Rarity: Uncommon</text><text>While you wear these boots, your steps make no sound, regardless of the surface you are moving across.

A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don\'t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.</text><text /><text>One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer\'s work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night\'s rest in a poor inn.</text><text /><text>One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.</text><text /><text>In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions.

The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is empty.</text><text>The fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors. with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the knock spell and similar magic, such as that of a chime of opening.</text><text>Each creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that aren\'t being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.</text><text>The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a wish spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of wish causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points.</text><text /><text>Source: Dungeon Master\'s Guide, page 160</text><roll>10d10</roll></item><item><name>Dagger</name><type>M</type><value>2gp</value><weight>1</weight><dmg1>1d4</dmg1><dmgType>P</dmgType><property>F,L,T</property><range>20/60</range><text>Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls.

The orb is the sphere\'s point of origin. The orb is destroyed after one use.</text><text>Fire Orb: When this orb detonates, it creates a dry heat wave that lasts for 24 hours. Within the area of effect, the rules for extreme heat apply, as detailed in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master\'s Guide. At the end of each hour, there is a ten percent chance that the heat wave starts a wildfire in a random location within the area of effect. The wildfire covers a 10-foot-square area initially but expands to fill another 10-foot square each round until the fire is extinguished or burns itself out. A creature that comes within 10 feet of a wildfire for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 3d6 fire damage.</text><text /><text>Source: Princes of the Apocalypse, page 222</text><roll>3d6</roll></item><item><name>Devastation Orb of Water</name><type>W</type><text>A devastation orb is an elemental bomb that can be created at the site of an elemental node by performing a ritual with an elemental weapon. The type of orb created depends on the node used. For example, an air node creates a devastation orb of air. The ritual takes 1 hour to complete and requires 2,000 gp worth of special components, which are consumed.</text><text>A devastation orb measures 12 inches in diameter, weighs 10 pounds, and has a solid outer shell. The orb detonates 1d100 hours after its creation, releasing the elemental energy it contains. The orb gives no outward sign of how much time remains before it will detonate. Spells such as identify and divination can be used to ascertain when the orb will explode. An orb has AC 10, 15 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing it to 0 hit points causes it to explode instantly.</text><text>A special container can be crafted to contain a devastation orb and prevent it from detonating. The container must be inscribed with symbols of the orb\'s opposing element. For example, a case inscribed with earth symbols can be used to contain a devastation orb of air and keep it from detonating. While in the container, the orb thrums. If it is removed from the container after the time when it was supposed to detonate, it explodes 1d6 rounds later, unless it is returned to the container.</text><text>Regardless of the type of orb, its effect is contained within a sphere with a 1 mile radius. The orb is the sphere\'s point of origin. The orb is destroyed after one use.</text><text>Water Orb: When this orb detonates, it creates a torrential rainstorm that lasts for 24 hours. Within the area of effect, the rules for heavy precipitation apply, as detailed in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master\'s Guide. If there is a substantial body of water in the area, it floods after 2d10 hours of heavy rain, rising 10 feet above its banks and inundating the surrounding area. The flood advances at a rate of 100 feet per round, moving away from the body of water where it began until it reaches the edge of the area of effect: at that point, the water flows downhill (and possibly recedes back to its origin). Light structures collapse and wash away. Any Large or smaller creature caught in the flood\'s path is swept away. The flooding destroys crops and might trigger mudslides, depending on the terrain.</text><text /><text>Source: Princes of the Apocalypse, page 222</text></item><item><name>Dice Set</name><type>G</type><value>1sp</value><text>If you are proficient with a gaming set, you can add your proficiency bonus to ability checks you make to play a game with that set.

It was once the horn of her ancient red dragon consort, Ephelomon, that she gave to dragonkind to help them in their war against the giants. The Draakhorn is a signaling device, and it is so large that it requires two Medium creatures (or one Large or larger) to hold it while a third creature sounds it, making the earth resonate to its call. The horn has been blasted with fire into a dark ebony hue and is wrapped in bands of bronze with draconic runes that glow with purple eldritch fire.</text><text>The low, moaning drone of the Draakhorn discomfits normal animals within a few miles, and it alerts all dragons within two thousand miles to rise and be wary, for great danger is at hand. Coded blasts were once used to signal specific messages. Knowledge of those codes has been lost to the ages.</text><text>Those with knowledge of the Draakhorn\'s history know that it was first built to signal danger to chromatic dragons — a purpose the Cult of the Dragon has corrupted to call chromatic dragons to the Well of Dragons from across the North.</text><text>Within 50 feet of any enclosed space where the horn is blown, the air begins to shimmer from the sound. Any character within 20 feet of the entry to the enclosed space must succeed on a DC 12 Strength check to continue pushing against the pressure of the sound. A failure indicates the character can advance no farther toward the entry.</text><text>For any character entering the enclosed space, the sound fades to silence — because any creature that enters the enclosed space is temporarily deafened and must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. Success indicates the deafness ends 2 minutes after the Draakhorn ceases to sound. Failure indicates the character remains deafened for 1 hour after the Draakhorn ceases to sound.</text><text>While the horn is sounding, a creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw the first time on a turn the creature enters a 150-foot cone in front of the horn or starts its turn there. On a failed save, the creature takes 27 (6d8) thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn\'t knocked prone.</text><text /><text>Source: The Rise of Tiamat, page 93</text><roll>6d8</roll></item><item><name>Dragon Slayer Greatsword</name><type>M</type><weight>6</weight><dmg1>2d6</dmg1><dmgType>S</dmgType><property>H,2H</property><rarity>Rare</rarity><text>Rarity: Rare</text><text>	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</text><text>When you hit a dragon with this weapon, the dragon takes an extra 3d6 damage of the weapon\'s type.

When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don\'t usually involve the exchange of individual coins.

Vecna was, in his time, one of the mightiest of all wizards. Through dark magic and conquest, he forged a terrible empire. For all his power, Vecna couldn\'t escape his own mortality. He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever coming about.</text><text>Orcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond death, he became the greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered and decayed, Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted Tower.</text><text>Some say that Vecna\'s lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the reason, Kas brought the Undying King\'s rule to an end in a terrible battle that left Vecna\'s tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One\'s will in the world.</text><text>The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a mummified and shriveled left extremity.</text><text>To attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die.</text><text>To attune to the hand, you must lop off your left hand at the wrist and the press the artifact against the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die.</text><text>Random Properties: The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna each have the following random properties: </text><text>• 1 minor beneficial property</text><text>• 1 major beneficial property</text><text>• 1 minor detrimental property</text><text>Properties of the Eye: Your alignment changes to neutral evil, and you gain the following benefits: </text><text>• You have truesight.</text><text>• You can use an action to see as if you were wearing a ring of X-ray vision. You can end this effect as a bonus action.</text><text>• The eye has 8 charges. You can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: clairvoyance (2 charges), crown of madness (1 charge), disintegrate (4 charges), dominate monster (5 charges), or eyebite (4 charges). The eye regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. Each time you cast a spell from the eye, there is a 5 percent chance that Vecna tears your soul from your body, devours it, and then takes control of the body like a puppet. If that happens, you become an NPC under the DM\'s control.</text><text>Properties of the Eye and Hand: If you are attuned to both the hand and eye, you gain the following additional benefits: </text><text>• You are immune to disease and poison.</text><text>• Using the eye\'s X-ray vision never causes you to suffer exhaustion.</text><text>• You experience premonitions of danger and, unless you are incapacitated, can\'t be surprised.</text><text>• If you start your turn with at least 1 hit point, you regain 1dl0 hit points.</text><text>• If a creature has a skeleton, you can attempt to turn its bones to jelly with a touch of the Hand of Vecna. You can do so by using an action to make a melee attack against a creature you can reach, using your choice your melee attack bonus for weapons or spells. On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points.</text><text>• You can use an action to cast wish. This property can\'t be used again until 30 days have passed.</text><text>Destroying the Eye and Hand: If the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna are both attached to the same creature, and that creature is slain by the Sword of Kas, both the eye and the hand burst into flame, turn to ash, and are destroyed forever. Any other attempt to destroy the eye or hand seems to work, but the artifact reappears in one of Vecna\'s many hidden vaults, where it waits to be rediscovered.</text><text /><text>Source: Dungeon Master\'s Guide, page 224</text></item><item><name>Eyes of Charming</name><type>W</type><rarity>Uncommon</rarity><text>Rarity: Uncommon</text><text>Requires Attunement</text><text /><text>These crystal lenses fit over the eyes.

Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:</text><text>• The goat of traveling can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can\'t be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.</text><text>• The goat of travail becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can\'t be used again until 30 days have passed.</text><text>• The goat of terror becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can\'t attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a +1 lance, and the other becomes a +2 longsword. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat\'s aura for the next 24 hours.

The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).</text><text /><text>With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don\'t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.</text><text /><text>One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer\'s work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night\'s rest in a poor inn.</text><text /><text>One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.</text><text /><text>In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.</text><text /><text>A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.</text><text /><text>Source: Player\'s Handbook, page 143</text></item><item><name>Gold Dragon Scale Mail</name><type>MA</type><weight>45</weight><ac>14</ac><stealth>YES</stealth><rarity>Very Rare</rarity><text>Rarity: Very Rare</text><text>Requires Attunement</text><text>	Dragon scale mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon.

Vecna was, in his time, one of the mightiest of all wizards. Through dark magic and conquest, he forged a terrible empire. For all his power, Vecna couldn\'t escape his own mortality. He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever coming about.</text><text>Orcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond death, he became the greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered and decayed, Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted Tower.</text><text>Some say that Vecna\'s lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the reason, Kas brought the Undying King\'s rule to an end in a terrible battle that left Vecna\'s tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One\'s will in the world.</text><text>The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a mummified and shriveled left extremity.</text><text>To attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die.</text><text>To attune to the hand, you must lop off your left hand at the wrist and the press the artifact against the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die.</text><text>Random Properties: The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna each have the following random properties: </text><text>• 1 minor beneficial property</text><text>• 1 major beneficial property</text><text>• 1 minor detrimental property</text><text>Properties of the Hand: Your alignment changes neutral evil, and you gain the following benefits: </text><text>• Your Strength score becomes 20, unless it is already 20 or higher.</text><text>• Any melee spell attack you make with the hand, and any melee weapon attack made with a weapon held by it, deals an extra 2d8 cold damage on a hit.</text><text>• The hand has 8 charges. You can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: finger of death (5 charges), sleep (1 charge), slow (2 charges), or teleport (3 charges). The hand regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. Each time you cast a spell from the hand, it casts the suggestion spell on you (save DC 18), demanding that you commit an evil act. The hand might have a specific act in mind or leave it up to you.</text><text>Properties of the Eye and Hand: If you are attuned to both the hand and eye, you gain the following additional benefits: </text><text>• You are immune to disease and poison.</text><text>• Using the eye\'s X-ray vision never causes you to suffer exhaustion.</text><text>• You experience premonitions of danger and, unless you are incapacitated, can\'t be surprised.</text><text>• If you start your turn with at least 1 hit point, you regain 1dl0 hit points.</text><text>• If a creature has a skeleton, you can attempt to turn its bones to jelly with a touch of the Hand of Vecna. You can do so by using an action to make a melee attack against a creature you can reach, using your choice your melee attack bonus for weapons or spells. On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points.</text><text>• You can use an action to cast wish. This property can\'t be used again until 30 days have passed.</text><text>Destroying the Eye and Hand: If the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna are both attached to the same creature, and that creature is slain by the Sword of Kas, both the eye and the hand burst into flame, turn to ash, and are destroyed forever. Any other attempt to destroy the eye or hand seems to work, but the artifact reappears in one of Vecna\'s many hidden vaults, where it waits to be rediscovered.</text><text /><text>Source: Dungeon Master\'s Guide, page 224</text></item><item><name>Handaxe</name><type>M</type><value>5gp</value><weight>2</weight><dmg1>1d6</dmg1><dmgType>S</dmgType><property>L,T</property><range>20/60</range><text>Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.</text><text /><text>Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property.

Any gem pried from the helm crumbles to dust. When all the gems are removed or destroyed, the helm loses its magic.</text><text>You gain the following benefits while wearing it:</text><text>• You can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18), using one of the helm\'s gems of the specified type as a component: daylight (opal), fireball (fire opal), prismatic spray (diamond), or wall of fire (ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.</text><text>• As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits dim light in a 30-foot radius when at least one undead is within that area. Any undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant damage.</text><text>• As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have resistance to fire damage.</text><text>• As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can use an action and speak a command word to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow the weapon.</text><text>Roll a d20 if you are wearing the helm and take fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems. Each creature within 60 feet of the helm other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm. The helm and its gems are then destroyed.</text><text /><text>Source: Dungeon Master\'s Guide, page 173</text><roll>1d6</roll></item><item><name>Helm of Comprehending Languages</name><type>W</type><rarity>Uncommon</rarity><text>Rarity: Uncommon</text><text>While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the comprehend languages spell from it at will.</text><text /><text>Source: Dungeon Master\'s Guide, page 173</text></item><item><name>Helm of Telepathy</name><type>W</type><rarity>Uncommon</rarity><text>Rarity: Uncommon</text><text>Requires Attunement</text><text /><text>While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the detect thoughts spell (save DC 13) from it.

The backpack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.</text><text>Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.</text><text>The haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.</text><text>Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10-feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes.

The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success.

You and the creature can then communicate normally.</text><text>In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free one creature trapped in the mirror.

In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one such blade. Over the centuries, some blades have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Other blades have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain.</text><text>A moonblade passes down from parent to child. The sword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to that person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies dormant. It functions like a normal longsword until a worthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power.</text><text>A moonblade serves only one master at a time. The attunement process requires a special ritual in the throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated to the elven gods.</text><text>A moonblade won\'t serve anyone it regards as craven, erratic, corrupt, or at odds with preserving and protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you make ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with disadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the blade. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed.</text><text>A moonblade has one rune on its blade for each master it has served (typically 1d6 + 1). The first rune always grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the moon blade an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it randomly on the Moon Blade Properties table.</text><text /><text>MOONBLADE PROPERTIES: </text><text>d100 — Property: </text><text>01-40 — Increase the bonus to attack and damage rolls by 1, to a maximum of +3. Reroll if the moonblade already has a +3 bonus.</text><text>41-80 — The moonblade gains a randomly determined minor property (see "Special Features" earlier in this chapter).</text><text>81-82 — The moonblade gains the finesse property.</text><text>83-84 — The moonblade gains the thrown property (range 20/60 feet).</text><text>85-86 — The moonblade functions as a defender.</text><text>87-90 — The moon blade scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.</text><text>91-92 — When you hit with an attack using the moon blade, the attack an extra 1d6 slashing damage.</text><text>93-94 — When you hit a creature of a specific type (such as dragon, fiend, or undead) with the moonblade, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of one of these types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.</text><text>95-96 — You can use a bonus action to cause the moonblade to flash brightly. Each creature that can see you and is within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can\'t be used again until you take a short rest while attuned to the weapon.</text><text>97-98 — The moonblade functions as a ring of spell storing.</text><text>99 — You can use an action to call forth an elfshadow, provided that you don\'t already have one serving you. The elfshadow appears in an unoccupied space within 120 feet of you. It uses the statistics for a shadow from the Monster Manual, except it is neutral, immune to effects that turn undead, and doesn\'t create new shadows. You control this creature, deciding how it acts and moves. It remains until it drops to 0 hit points or you dismiss it as an action.</text><text>00 — The moonblade functions as a vorpal sword.</text><text /><text>Sentience: A moon blade is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</text><text>The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder\'s hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate more explicitly, through visions or dreams, when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep.</text><text>Personality: Every moonblade seeks the advancement of elvenkind and elven ideals. Courage, loyalty, beauty, music, and life are all part of this purpose.</text><text>The weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to serve. Once it has bonded with an owner who shares its ideals, its loyalty is absolute.</text><text>If a moon blade has a flaw, it is overconfidence. Once it has decided on an owner, it believes that only that person should wield it, even if the owner falls short of elven ideals.</text><text /><text>Source: Dungeon Master\'s Guide, page 217</text><modifier category="bonus">melee attacks +1</modifier><modifier category="bonus">melee damage +1</modifier></item><item><name>Morningstar</name><type>M</type><value>15gp</value><weight>4</weight><dmg1>1d8</dmg1><dmgType>P</dmgType><text>Source: Player\'s Handbook, page 149</text></item><item><name>Morningstar +1</name><type>M</type><weight>4</weight><dmg1>1d8</dmg1><dmgType>P</dmgType><rarity>Uncommon</rarity><text>Rarity: Uncommon</text><text>	You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.</text><text /><text>Source: Dungeon Master\'s Guide, page 213</text><modifier category="bonus">melee attacks +1</modifier><modifier category="bonus">melee damage +1</modifier></item><item><name>Morningstar +2</name><type>M</type><weight>4</weight><dmg1>1d8</dmg1><dmgType>P</dmgType><rarity>Rare</rarity><text>Rarity: Rare</text><text>	You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.</text><text /><text>Source: Dungeon Master\'s Guide, page 213</text><modifier category="bonus">melee attacks +2</modifier><modifier category="bonus">melee damage +2</modifier></item><item><name>Morningstar +3</name><type>M</type><weight>4</weight><dmg1>1d8</dmg1><dmgType>P</dmgType><rarity>Very Rare</rarity><text>Rarity: Very Rare</text><text>	You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.</text><text /><text>Source: Dungeon Master\'s Guide, page 213</text><modifier category="bonus">melee attacks +3</modifier><modifier category="bonus">melee damage +3</modifier></item><item><name>Morningstar of Warning</name><type>M</type><weight>4</weight><dmg1>1d8</dmg1><dmgType>P</dmgType><rarity>Uncommon</rarity><text>Rarity: Uncommon</text><text>Requires Attunement</text><text>	This magic weapon warns you of danger.

When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High Sorcery came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five Orbs of Dragonkind (or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.</text><text>As the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.</text><text>Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.</text><text>An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.</text><text>While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb\'s depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.</text><text>While you are charmed by the orb, you can\'t voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Takhisis (Tiamat\'s name on Krynn), or something else the DM decides.</text><text>Random Properties: An Orb of Dragon kind has the following random properties: </text><text>• 2 minor beneficial properties</text><text>• 1 minor detrimental property</text><text>• 1 major detrimental property</text><text>Spells: The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: cure wounds (5th-level version, 3 charges), daylight (1 charge), death ward (2 charges), or scrying (3 charges). You can also use an action to cast the detect magic spell from the orb without using any charges.</text><text>Call Dragons: While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can\'t be used again for 1 hour.</text><text>Destroying an Orb: An Orb of Dragonkind appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A disintegrate spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.</text><text /><text>Source: Dungeon Master\'s Guide, page 225</text></item><item><name>Orb of the Stein Rune</name><type>W</type><text>This item requires attunement</text><rarity>Rare</rarity><text>Rarity: Rare</text><text /><text>This orb of granite is about the size of an adult human’s ﬁst.

For the next minute or until you move any distance, you have advantage on all checks and saving throws to resist effects that force you to move. In addition, any enemy that moves to a space within 10 feet of you must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be unable to move any farther this turn.</text><text>Stone Soul: You can’t be petriﬁed.</text><text>Earthen Step: You can cast meld into stone as a bonus action. Once you use this property, you can’t use it again until you ﬁnish a short or long rest.</text><text>Gift of Stone: You can transfer the orb’s magic to a nonmagical item—a shield or a pair of boots—by tracing the stein rune there with your ﬁnger. The transfer takes8 hours of work that requires the two items to be within 5 feet of each other. At the end, the orb is destroyed, and the rune appears in silver on the chosen item, which gains a beneﬁt based on its form:</text><text>Shield.

Its head is graven with the Dwarvish runes for "orc," but the runes are depicted with a gap or slash through the markings; the word "orc" is literally split in two.</text><text>You gain the following benefits while holding this magic weapon:</text><text>• You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</text><text>• When you roll a 20 on an attack roll with this weapon against an orc, that orc must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points.</text><text>• You can\'t be surprised by orcs while you\'re not incapacitated. You are also aware when orcs are within 120 feet of you and aren\'t behind total cover, although you don\'t know their location.</text><text>• You and any of your friends within 30 feet of you can\'t be frightened while you\'re not incapacitated.</text><text>Sentience: Orcsplitter is a sentient, lawful good weapon with an Intelligence of 6, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 10. It can see and hear out to 120 feet and has darkvision. It communicates by transmitting emotions to its wielder, although on rare occasions it uses a limited form of telepathy to bring to the wielder\'s mind a couplet or stanza of ancient Dwarvish verse.</text><text>Personality: Orcsplitter is grim, taciturn, and inflexible. It knows little more than the desire to face orcs in battle and serve a courageous, just wielder. It disdains cowards and any form of duplicity, deception, or disloyalty. The weapon\'s purpose is to defend dwarves and to serve as a symbol of dwarven resolve. It hates the traditional foes of dwarves — giants, goblins, and, most of all, orcs — and silently urges its possessor to meet such creatures in battle.</text><text /><text>Heavy: Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons.

If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can\'t hear the pipes\' music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can\'t be swayed by the pipes\' music for the next 24 hours.</text><text /><text>Source: Dungeon Master\'s Guide, page 185</text><roll>1d3</roll></item><item><name>Pitcher</name><type>G</type><value>2cp</value><weight>4</weight><text>A pitcher holds 1 gallon of liquid.</text><text /><text>Source: Player\'s Handbook, page 153</text></item><item><name>Piton</name><type>G</type><value>5cp</value><weight>0.25</weight><text>Source: Player\'s Handbook, page 150</text></item><item><name>Piwafwi (Cloak of Elvenkind)</name><type>W</type><text>Requires Attunement</text><text>This dark spider-silk cloak is made by drow.

The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).</text><text /><text>With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don\'t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.</text><text /><text>One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer\'s work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night\'s rest in a poor inn.</text><text /><text>One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.</text><text /><text>In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.</text><text /><text>A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.</text><text /><text>Source: Player\'s Handbook, page 143</text></item><item><name>Playing Card Set</name><type>G</type><value>5sp</value><text>If you are proficient with a gaming set, you can add your proficiency bonus to ability checks you make to play a game with that set.

The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can\'t be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open portable hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it.</text><text>You can use an action to close a portable hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space.

On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the portable hole or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed portable hole can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.</text><text>Placing a portable hole inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, Heward\'s handy haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane.

You must have seen the target before, but you don\'t need to see it now. If the target isn\'t within range or if there is no clear path to it, the dart falls to the ground, its magic spent and wasted. Otherwise, elemental winds guide the dart instantly through the air to the target. The dart can pass though openings as narrow as 1 inch wide and can change direction to fly around corners.</text><text>When the dart reaches its target, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and 3d4 lightning damage.

If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.</text><text /><text>Source: Princes of the Apocalypse, page 223</text><roll>3d4</roll></item><item><name>Sending Stones</name><type>W</type><rarity>Uncommon</rarity><text>Rarity: Uncommon</text><text>Sending stones come in pairs, with each smooth stone carved to match the other so the pairing is easily recognized.

A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don\'t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.</text><text /><text>One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer\'s work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night\'s rest in a poor inn.</text><text /><text>One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.</text><text /><text>In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.</text><text /><text>A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.</text><text /><text>Source: Player\'s Handbook, page 143</text></item><item><name>Silver Dragon Scale Mail</name><type>MA</type><weight>45</weight><ac>14</ac><stealth>YES</stealth><rarity>Very Rare</rarity><text>Rarity: Very Rare</text><text>Requires Attunement</text><text>	Dragon scale mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon.

The tree appears ordinary but radiates a faint aura of transmutation magic if targeted by detect magic. While touching the tree and using another action to speak its command, word, you return the staff to its normal form. Any creature in the tree falls when it reverts to a staff.</text><text /><text>Source: Dungeon Master\'s Guide, page 204</text><modifier category="bonus">spell attack +2</modifier><roll>1d6+4</roll></item><item><name>Steel Mirror</name><type>G</type><value>5gp</value><weight>0.5</weight><text>Source: Player\'s Handbook, page 150</text></item><item><name>Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals</name><type>W</type><weight>5</weight><rarity>Rare</rarity><text>Rarity: Rare</text><text>If the stone is touching the ground, you can use an action to speak its command word and summon an earth elemental, as if you had cast the conjure elemental spell.

In its original form, it had a platinum hilt and guard, and a thin crystal blade as strong as steel.</text><text>	Strahd employed a powerful wizard named Khazan to destroy the weapon after Sergei\'s death. The first part of the process required the hilt and the blade to be separated, which Khazan accomplished. While Khazan was busying himself destroying the blade, his apprentice stole the hilt and fled. Khazan later located his apprentice\'s mutilated corpse in the Svalich Woods, but the hilt was nowhere to be found. To avoid the vampire\'s wrath, Khazan told Strahd that the entire weapon had been destroyed.</text><text>	The hilt, which is sentient, knows that it can never be reunited with its original crystal blade.

This despicable villain served as advisor, warlord, and assassin. His successes earned him Vecna\'s admiration and a reward: a sword with as dark a pedigree as the man who would wield it.</text><text>For a long time, Kas faithfully served the lich but as Kas\'s power grew, so did his hubris. His sword urged him to supplant Vecna, so that they could rule the lich\'s empire in Vecna\'s stead. Legend says Vecna\'s destruction came at Kas\'s hand, but Vecna also wrought his rebellious lieutenant\'s doom, leaving only Kas\'s sword behind. The world was made brighter thereby.</text><text>The Sword of Kas is a magic, sentient longsword that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, and deals an extra 2d10 slashing damage to undead.</text><text>If the sword isn\'t bathed in blood within 1 minute of being drawn from its scabbard, its wielder must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the wielder takes 3d6 psychic damage. On a failed save, the wielder is dominated by the sword, as if by the dominate monster spell, and the sword demands that it be bathed in blood. The spell effect ends when the sword\'s demand is met.</text><text>Random Properties: The Sword of Kas has the following random properties: </text><text>• 1 minor beneficial property</text><text>• 1 major beneficial property</text><text>• 1 minor detrimental property</text><text>• 1 major detrimental property</text><text>Spirit of Kas: While the sword is on your person, you add a d10 to your initiative at the start of every combat. In addition, when you use an action to attack with the sword, you can transfer some or all of its attack bonus to your Armor Class instead. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn.</text><text>Spells: While the sword is on your person, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save 18) from it: call lightning, divine word, or finger of death. Once you use the sword to cast a spell, you can\'t cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.</text><text>Sentience: The Sword of Kas is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 13, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to 2 range of 120 feet.</text><text>The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common</text><text>Personality: The sword\'s purpose is to bring ruin to Vecna. Killing Vecna\'s worshipers, destroying the lich\'s works, and foiling his machinations all help to fulfill this goal.</text><text>The Sword of Kas also seeks to destroy anyone corrupted by the Eye and Hand of Vecna. The sword\'s obsession with those artifacts eventually becomes a fixation for its wielder.</text><text>Destroying the Sword: A creature attuned to both the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna can use the wish property of those combined artifacts to unmake the Sword of Kas. The creature must cast the wish spell and make a Charisma check contested by the Charisma check of the sword. The sword must be within 30 feet of the creature, or the spell fails. If the sword wins the contest, nothing happens, and the wish spell is wasted. If the sword loses the contest, it is destroyed.</text><text /><text>Source: Dungeon Master\'s Guide, page 226</text><modifier category="bonus">melee attacks +3</modifier><modifier category="bonus">melee damage +3</modifier></item><item><name>Talisman of Pure Good</name><type>W</type><weight>1</weight><rarity>Legendary</rarity><text>Rarity: Legendary</text><text>Requires Attunement by a Creature of Good Alignment</text><text /><text>This talisman is a mighty symbol of goodness.

On a hit, the tentacle deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage. If you hit a target with all three tentacles, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature\'s speed is halved, it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it can\'t use reactions for 1 minute. Moreover, on each of its turns, it can take either an action or a bonus action, but not both.

It also can\'t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevent it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

The device, as evil as its creator, shares the demon lord\'s aims to snuff out the lives of all living things and bind the Material Plane in the stasis of undeath. Orcus allows the wand to slip from his grasp from time to time. When it does, it magically appears wherever its master senses an opportunity to achieve some fell goal.</text><text>Made from bones as hard as iron, the wand is topped with a magically enlarged skull that once belonged to a human hero slain by Orcus. The wand can magically change in size to better conform to the grip of its user. Plants wither, drinks spoil, flesh rots, and vermin thrive in the wand\'s presence.</text><text>Any creature besides Orcus that tries to attune to the wand must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes 10d6 necrotic damage. On a failed save, the creature dies and rises as a zombie.</text><text>In the hands of one who is attuned to it, the wand can be wielded as a magic mace that grants a+3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The wand deals an extra 2d12 necrotic damage on a hit.</text><text>Random Properties: The Wand of Orcus has the following random properties: </text><text>• 2 minor beneficial properties</text><text>• 1 major beneficial property</text><text>• 2 minor detrimental properties</text><text>• 1 major detrimental property</text><text>The detrimental properties of the Wand of Orcus are suppressed while the wand is attuned to Orcus himself.</text><text>Protection: You gain a +3 bonus to Armor Class while holding the wand.</text><text>Spells: The wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action and expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: animate dead (1 charge), blight (2 charges), circle of death (3 charges), finger of death (3 charges), power word kill (4 charges), or speak with dead (1 charge). The wand regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn.</text><text>While attuned to the wand, Orcus or a follower blessed by him can cast each of the wand\'s spells using 2 fewer charges (minimum of 0).</text><text>Call Undead: While you are holding the wand, you can use an action to conjure skeletons and zombies, calling forth as many of them as you can divide 500 hit points among, each undead having average hit points (see the Monster Manual for statistics). The undead magically rise up from the ground or otherwise form in unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of you and obey your commands until they are destroyed or until dawn of the next day, when they collapse into inanimate piles of bones and rotting corpses. Once you use this property of the wand, you can\'t use it again until the next dawn.</text><text>While attuned to the wand, Orcus can summon any kind of undead, not just skeletons and zombies. The undead don\'t perish or disappear at dawn the following day, remaining until Orcus dismisses them.</text><text>Sentience: The Wand of Orcus is a sentient, chaotic evil item with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</text><text>The wand communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal and Common.</text><text>Personality: The wand\'s purpose is to help satisfy Orcus\'s desire to slay everything in the multiverse. The wand is cold, cruel, nihilistic, and bereft of humor. In order to further its master\'s goals, the wand feigns devotion to its current user and makes grandiose promises that it has no intention of fulfilling, such as vowing to help its user overthrow Orcus.</text><text>Destroying the Wand: Destroying the Wand of Orcus requires that it be taken to the Positive Energy Plane by the ancient hero whose skull surmounts it. For this to happen, the long-lost hero must first be restored to life — no easy task, given the fact that Orcus has imprisoned the hero\'s soul and keeps it hidden and well guarded.</text><text>Bathing the wand in positive energy causes it to crack and explode, but unless the above conditions are met, the wand instantly reforms on Orcus\'s layer of the Abyss.</text><text /><text>Source: Dungeon Master\'s Guide, page 227</text><modifier category="bonus">melee attacks +3</modifier><modifier category="bonus">melee damage +3</modifier><modifier category="bonus">ac +3</modifier></item><item><name>Wand of Paralysis</name><type>WD</type><weight>1</weight><rarity>Rare</rarity><text>Rarity: Rare</text><text>Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster</text><text /><text>This wand has 7 charges.

At dawn the day after you first make an attack roll with Whelm, you develop a fear of being outdoors that persists as long as you remain attuned to the weapon. This causes you to have disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks while you can see the daytime sky.</text><text>Thrown Weapon: Whelm has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using it, the target takes an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage, or an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage if the target is a giant. Each time you throw the weapon, it flies back to your hand after the attack.

In addition, you can use an action to cast detect evil and good or locate object from the weapon. Once you cast either spell, you can\'t cast it from the weapon again until the next dawn.</text><text>Sentience: Whelm is a sentient lawful neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</text><text>The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Dwarvish. Giant, and Goblin. It shouts battle cries in Dwarvish when used in combat.</text><text>Personality: Whelm\'s purpose is to slaughter giants and goblinoids. It also seeks to protect dwarves against all enemies. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to destroy goblins and giants or to protect dwarves. Whelm has ties to the dwarf clan that created it, variously called the Dankil or the Mightyhammer clan. It longs to be returned to that clan. It would do anything to protect those dwarves from harm. The hammer also carries a secret shame. Centuries ago, a dwarf named Ctenmiir wielded it valiantly for a time. But Ctenmiir was turned into a vampire. His will was strong enough that he bent Whelm to his evil purposes, even killing members of his own clan.</text><text /><text>Source: Dungeon Master\'s Guide, page 218</text><modifier category="bonus">melee attacks +3</modifier><modifier category="bonus">melee damage +3</modifier></item><item><name>Whetstone</name><type>G</type><value>1cp</value><weight>1</weight><text>Source: Player\'s Handbook, page 150</text></item><item><name>Whip</name><type>M</type><value>2gp</value><weight>3</weight><dmg1>1d4</dmg1><dmgType>S</dmgType><property>F,R</property><text>Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls.

If you already have immunity to cold damage from another source, whenever you are subjected to cold damage, you take none of that damage and regain a number of hit points equal to half the damage dealt of that type.</text><text /><text>Draconic Majesty: While you are wearing no armor, you can add your Charisma bonus to your Armor Class.</text><text /><text>Dragon Breath: If you have a breath weapon that requires rest to recharge, it gains a recharge of 6.</text><text /><text>Dragon Sight: You gain darkvision out to 60 feet, or to an additional 60 feet if you already have that sense. Once per day, you can gain blindsight out to 30 feet for 5 minutes.</text><text /><text>Dragon Tongue: You can speak and understand Draconic. You also have advantage on any Charisma check you make against White Dragons.</text><text /><text>Legendary Resistance: (1/Day) If you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead.</text><text /><text>Winter\'s Fury: While your current hit points are equal to or less than half your hit point maximum, you deal an extra 1d8 cold damage with your melee attacks.</text><text /><text>Source: Rise of Tiamat Online Supplement, page 4</text></item><item><name>White Dragon Scale Mail</name><type>MA</type><weight>45</weight><ac>14</ac><stealth>YES</stealth><rarity>Very Rare</rarity><text>Rarity: Very Rare</text><text>Requires Attunement</text><text>	Dragon scale mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off scales and gift them to humanoids. Other times, hunters carefully skin and preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case, dragon scale mail is highly valued. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, you have advantage on saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons of dragons, and you have resistance to cold damage.</text><text>Additionally, you can focus your senses as an action to magically discern the distance and direction to the closest white dragon within 30 miles of you. This special action can\'t be used again until the next dawn.</text><text /><text>Source: Dungeon Master\'s Guide, page 165</text><modifier category="bonus">ac +1</modifier></item><item><name>Wind Fan</name><type>W</type><rarity>Uncommon</rarity><text>Rarity: Uncommon</text><text>While holding this fan, you can use an action to cast the gust of wind spell (save DC 13) from it. Once used, the fan shouldn\'t be used again until the next dawn. Each time it is used again before then, it has a cumulative 20 percent chance of not working and tearing into useless, nonmagical tatters.</text><text /><text>Source: Dungeon Master\'s Guide, page 213</text></item><item><name>Windvane</name><type>M</type><weight>3</weight><dmg1>1d6</dmg1><dmg2>1d8</dmg2><dmgType>P</dmgType><property>T,V</property><range>20/60</range><text>Requires Attunement</text><text /><text>A silver spear, Windvane has dark sapphires on the filigreed surface of its polished head. Held by its shining haft, the weapon feels insubstantial, as if clutching a cool, gently flowing breeze. The spear contains a spark of Yan-C-Bin, the Prince of Evil Air.</text><text>You have a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls you make with this magic weapon, which has the finesse weapon property. When you hit with it, the target takes an extra 1d6 lightning damage.</text><text>Air Mastery: You gain the following benefits while you hold Windvane:</text><text>• You can speak Auran fluently.</text><text>• You have resistance to lightning damage.</text><text>• You can cast dominate monster (save DC 17) on an air elemental. Once you have done so, Windvane can\'t be used this way again until the next dawn.</text><text>Song of the Four Winds: While inside an air node, you can perform a ritual called the Song of the Four Winds, using Windvane to create a devastation orb of air (see the devastation orb description for the time and cost of the ritual). Once you perform the ritual, Windvane can\'t be used to perform the ritual again until the next dawn.</text><text>Flaw: Windvane makes its wielder mercurial and unreliable. While attuned to the weapon, you gain the following flaw: "I break my vows and plans. Duty and honor mean nothing to me."</text><text /><text>Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon\'s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon\'s maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can\'t attack a target beyond the weapon\'s long range</text><text /><text>Thrown: If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.</text><text /><text>Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property — the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</text><text /><text>Source: Princes of the Apocalypse, page 224</text><modifier category="bonus">weapon attacks +2</modifier><modifier category="bonus">weapon damage +2</modifier><roll>1d6</roll></item><item><name>Winged Boots</name><type>W</type><rarity>Uncommon</rarity><text>Rarity: Uncommon</text><text>Requires Attunement</text><text /><text>While you wear these boots, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed.

At the end of each of your turns, your altitude drops by 5 feet. Your altitude drops instantly to 0 feet at the end of your turn if you didn\'t fly at least 30 feet horizontally on that turn.

The throne hovers a foot off the ground and is a massive thing made of polished obsidian with oversized feet—the impaled skulls of four ancient blue dragons. Runes glisten in the carved obsidian winking to life with blue energy when the throne\'s powers are activated.</text><text>After the fall of Shanatar, the Wyrmskull Throne fell into the clutches of less honorable creatures. A band of adventurers wrested the throne from the aquatic elf tyrant Gantar Kraok and sold it to the storm giant Neri for a considerable fortune. Neri had the throne magically enlarged and gave it to her husband, King Hekaton, as a gift, along with one of the Ruling Scepters of Shanatar, which she had found in a wreck at the bottom of the Trackless Sea. Only a creature attuned to a Ruling Scepter and in possession of it can harness the powers of the Wyrmskull Throne, which has become the centerpiece of King Ilekaton’s throne room in the undersea citadel of Maelstrom. Fear of the throne\'s power has helped prevent evil giants from challenging or threatening Hekaton\'s leadership.</text><text>Any creature not attuned to a Ruling Scepter who sits on the throne is paralyzed and encased in a magical force ﬁeld. While encased, the creature can\'t be touched or moved from the throne. Touching a Ruling Scepter to the force ﬁeld dispels the ﬁeld, though the creature remains paralyzed until it is separated from the throne.</text><text>Any creature seated on the throne can hear faint Whispers in Draconic- the whisperings of four blue dragons whose skulls adorn the throne. Although powerless, these spirits try to influence the decisions of the throne\'s master</text><text>Properties of the Throne: The throne has 9 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. A creature that sits on the throne while attuned to a Ruling Sceptor in its possession can harness the throne’s properties, which are as follows:</text><text>The throne gains a ﬂying speed of 30 feet and can hover and ﬂies where the creature wills. This property doesn’t expend any charges.</text><text>Both the throne and the creature sitting on it can move through earth and stone without disturbing the material they move through. This property doesn\'t expend any charges.</text><text>As an action, the creature can expend 1 charge to cast lightning bolt (spell save DC 19) from the throne. The spell is cast as though using a 9th-level spell slot and deals 49 (14d6) lightning damage. The bolt discharges from the mouth of one of the throne’s blue dragon skulls.</text><text>As an action, the creature can expend 2 charges to cast the globe of invulnerability spell from the throne. The globe encloses both the creature and the throne.</text><text>As an action, the creature can expend 3 charges to create a spectral image of an ancient blue dragon that surrounds both it and the throne. The spectral dragon lasts for 1 minute. At the end of each of the creature’s turns, the spectral dragon makes one bite attack and two claw attacks against targets of the creature’s choice. These attacks have the same attack bonus, reach, and damage as an ancient blue dragon’s bite and claw attacks.</text><text /><text>Destroying the Throne. The Wyrmskull Throne can be destroyed by breaking at least ﬁve Ruling Scepters of Shanatar simultaneously on it. This fact has never been recorded or sung of among the dwarves or any bards or storytellers, and it can’t be discovered with an ability check. Characters who want to destroy the throne must go on a quest to learn the method for doing so. The throne’s destruction triggers an explosion, as shards of obsidian ﬂy out in all directions. Each creature and object within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the throne must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 (2Od6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. </text><text /><text>Source: Storm King\'s Thunder, page 237</text></item><item><name>Wyvern Poison (Injury)</name><type>G</type><value>1200gp</value><weight>0</weight><text>This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated wyvern.
