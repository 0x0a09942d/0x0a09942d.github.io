				"PAHMET TOMB GUARDIANS While most scholars consider the legends that Pahmet dwarves were sent by the gods to aid Osirion's pharaohs mere fancy, the ancient pharaohs treated the Pahmet with great reverence. In return, the dwarves guard Erekrus\u2014the necropolis where the Pahmet traditionally interred the bodies of pharaohs they deemed particularly worthy\u2014from undead and tomb robbers to this day.",
				"Elves Elves are an ancient people, heirs to a civilization founded in the depths of humanity's prehistory. Migrants from the elven realm of Sovyrian first came to Golarion through a magical gate that stretched between worlds, powered by an enormous crystal known as the Sovyrian Stone. At the height of their power, the elves clashed with the alien manipulators known as the alghollthus, and by extension the human empire that, wittingly or unwittingly, served the alghollthus' interests\u2014Azlant. When Azlant's defiance resulted in the alghollthus summoning the disaster of Earthfall, most of the elves departed the planet, traveling back to their homeland to escape the destruction.",
				"Yet this was far from the end of the elves' involvement on Golarion. Not all elves left with their kin, some instead choosing to remain behind. Even the elves of Sovyrian still had their part to play in the planet's history. Sensing that something threatened the Sovyrian Stone and the magical portal that it powered, the elves began their return to Golarion in 2632 ar. They returned to find their former lands corrupted by the nascent demon lord Treerazer, who sought to corrupt the Sovyrian Stone into a portal to the Abyss. The resulting war between the elves and Treerazer left the demon confined to the Tanglebriar forest, defeated but still alive. With the battle against Treerazer fought to a hard-won standstill, the elves turned their attention to reclaiming their ancient holdings, and with it, their place upon Golarion.",
				"Though elves can appear similar to humans at a first glance, they are as otherworldly and mercurial as their distant homeland, appearing approachable in one instant and incomprehensible in the next. Elves are usually tall and slender. Their eyes range across a spectrum of colors, with irises that are far larger than those of other humanoids; this usually makes it seem like elves have little or even no white in their eyes.",
				"Elves' natural lifespan is measured in centuries rather than decades, often leaving them unable to relate to the mindsets of shorter-lived peoples. While their love of music and beauty is well known by others, elves' love of freedom runs just as deep, and many elves feel uncomfortable telling others how to live their lives\u2014to the point that most elven states hesitate to demand military service or collective action from their citizens. Many human nations have felt betrayed by the lack of organized elven aid during a crisis, despite the help of individual elves, due to this misunderstanding of the elven viewpoint.",
				"This love of freedom leads elves out into the world for a nigh-infinite number of reasons, making them a common sight among adventurers.",
				"Their long lifespans mean that even elves who have spent centuries in quiet contemplation might be drawn out from their homes due to exceptional events, or that an elf might find herself journeying to follow up on events that are fresh in her memory but long forgotten to others. Though elves often try to keep themselves distant from shorter-lived peoples, knowing that such friendships will inevitably bring grief, many wind up forging longlasting connections with traveling companions that can even carry down through generations.",
				"Elves of the Inner Sea Elves' longevity means that their cultures remain stable over time, leading to a larger consolidation of elven ethnicities across the Inner Sea region.",
				"Elven societies that have been separated for thousands of years can still communicate with each other in the Elven language, with only minor difficulty. Within these broad ethnicities, however, is countless variation, fueled by the elven love of selfexpression and freedom. Elves also develop a powerful connection to their KYONIN A prominent nation in Avistan, Kyonin is considered the spiritual heartland of elven culture. This prestige comes from the presence of the Sovyrian Stone that resides in Kyonin's capital, Iadara, and the accompanying magical gate that leads to the realm of Sovyrian. The threat of the returned Whispering Tyrant has led Queen Telandia Edasseril to open the borders of the nation to foreigners.",
				"surroundings, and elves who live in an area for long enough are known to slowly shift in appearance to take on aspects of their environment. As a result, elves of any ethnicity are {@condition prone} to unusual features of all kinds, from white or lavender hair to bright gold eyes.",
				"While the elven idea of ethnicity closely matches that of humans, one important aspect of it is often lost on non-elven peoples. A number of elves\u2014including the ancestors of the Mualijae, Ilverani, and Vourinoi elves\u2014did not depart Golarion during Earthfall, while the ancestors of the Aiudeen and Spiresworn elves left for the land of Sovyrian. Though the elves of Sovyrian returned centuries ago, they are in some ways considered newcomers by themselves and their kin, still tied to an ancient and distant homeland on another world. In contrast, those elves who stayed behind during Earthfall and suffered alongside the planet during its darkest hour now consider themselves true children of Golarion.",
				"Aiudeen Also known as \"returners,\" Aiudeen are the most common elven ethnicity found in the Inner Sea region, mainly concentrated in the elven nation of Kyonin.",
				"These elves are the descendants of the elves who left Golarion when Earthfall struck, and they still guard the massive portal to their refuge of Sovyrian, along with the Sovyrian Stone that powers the gate. Aiudeen are also known for making use of a network of smaller portals, known as aiudara, that connect to gates in distant parts of Golarion. To most Inner Sea residents, all elven culture is Aiudeen culture, filled with glamorous clothing, arcane prowess, and elegant twisting architecture. Yet though Aiudeen culture is highly sophisticated, it has historically been in decline since the elves returned, as Aiudeen struggle to reclaim what they once held and defend what they've managed to reclaim. With major changes on the horizon, many Aiudeen seek to look to the future instead of to the past, opening their ancestral homes to outsiders and reaching out to interact with their neighbors.",
				"Most Aiudeen have the ancient elf (page 25), whisper elf, or woodland elf heritage, though due to the elves' ability to adapt to their environments, they could manifest any heritage.",
				"Ilverani Living in the most {@condition hostile} reaches of the Crown of the World, these elves are called \"snowcasters\" by almost all who know of them, as their traditions warn them to never share their true names with outsiders. Their name for themselves is Ilverani, derived from the name of their Mierani ancestors, who once resided in Mierani Forest. Ilverani are starkly marked by their frost-white skin and hair, as well as their affinity for blue clothes and silver armor. They live among elven ruins in the frozen wastes, holding an extreme religious reverence for the places they call home. For the most part, they are as cold and unyielding as the ice that surrounds them, willing to do good for others but seemingly incapable of behaving warmly to non-elves. The one exception are the Twilight Speakers, Ilverani who believe that reaching out to and befriending other peoples is a religious duty to their patron goddess, Findeladlara.",
				"While many might wonder why a goddess of elven architecture\u2014and one known for her unwillingness to answer non-elves\u2014would encourage such behavior, this odd tradition stems from an aspect of elven history lost to most of Golarion. When Earthfall struck, many of the Mierani elves fled to Sovyrian, while others chose to escape underground. One group of elves, however, elected to stay on the surface for the express purpose of creating magical shelters to save as many other people as possible. The descendants of these elves eventually traveled north and became Ilverani. While they no longer need to build such elven shelters, helping others is still considered an honor to that legacy and thus to Findeladlara. That Ilverani as a whole are now so mistrusting of strangers may speak of some manner of great betrayal in the past, perhaps one connected to Findeladlara's refusal to accept the worship of non-elves.",
				"Ilverani almost always have the arctic elf heritage. They often select the {@feat Unwavering Mien} ancestry feat, as their cold and emotionless demeanor provides a measure of protection against mental manipulation.",
				"Mualijae Mualijae are jungle-dwelling elves who reside in the Mwangi Expanse, enigmas to most due to their dislike of trespassers. Guardians and stewards of their homelands, Mualijae were among those elves who did not depart Golarion during Earthfall, and their legends claim they remained behind to protect the world in the dark days to come. Whether these claims are true or not, Mualijae take their self-appointed stewardship very seriously, training themselves to stand ready to fight against anything that might threaten the world. Mualijae long ago split into three separate subgroups: Alijae, Ekujae, and Kallijae. Alijae are accustomed to the worst of the Mwangi's heat, with dark-brown skin and coily, dark-brown hair. Ekujae tend toward dark skin and eyes but are {@condition prone} to individual variation from these norms, and are the Mualijae most likely to interact with outsiders. Kallijae have straighter hair than their kin and are seen only rarely outside their own lands.",
				"Mualijae elves have the dark skin and black hair of their human neighbors, and they usually possess jet-black eyes. Individual variations are common, however, such as rose-gold hair or glowing orange eyes. Fashion varies wildly between nations, but Mualijae tend to favor garb made from plants and wood, as well as natural materials such as bone, furs, and leathers. Most Mualijae cultures have some manner of taboos or customs around metal and gems, though these traditions likewise vary by nation.",
				"Mualijae elves usually have the woodland elf heritage, though they might instead have the seer elf or whisper elf heritage. They often select the Wildborn Magic feat (page 26) to represent a mystic connection to their jungle surroundings.",
				"Spiresworn An offshoot of Aiudeen elves, Spiresworn are elves who reside within the Mordant Spire, a strange tower that grew in the place where the falling body of Acavna\u2014the Azlanti goddess of the moon and battle who died during Earthfall trying to defend her people\u2014had crashed into the earth. The tower whispered to them in a dead god's voice, and within these divine whispers, the Spiresworn found a calling. Now considering themselves the true heirs of Azlant, the elves settled in the Mordant Spire and cut themselves off from the rest of the world. After generations of this isolation, the elves of the Mordant Spire have become secretive and xenophobic, bizarre even to their former brethren. Often refusing to speak anything but Azlanti, they wear elaborate wooden masks whenever dealing with outsiders, and they often change the subject or stop speaking mid-sentence, cocking their heads as if listening to an inaudible voice.",
				"Beneath their masks, Spiresworn elves often have white hair and violet eyes; they have a wide range of skin tones, but their complexion is often ashen from a lack of light. Spiresworn rarely leave their island for any reason beyond patrolling Azlanti ruins, defending them from explorers seeking to claim ancient secrets.",
				"As a result, Spiresworn are rarely seen as adventurers. In recent years, however, some of these elves have found themselves grudgingly forced to work with others to face larger alghollthu threats, and thus they have been pulled into worldly affairs.",
				"AQUATIC ELVES Kin to terrestrial elves despite their incompatible environments, aquatic elves were once air-breathing elves who eventually adapted to life underwater due to their exposure to the sea. Much like Mordant Spire elves, aquatic elves consider themselves enemies of the alghollthus and fight to oppose the aberrations at every turn.",
				"Spiresworn elves often have the seer elf or whisper elf heritage, though those who remain within the Mordant Spire itself might have the cavern elf heritage. They commonly select the Unwavering Mien or {@feat Otherworldly Magic} ancestry feat in order to represent their unusual connection to the Mordant Spire.",
				"Vourinoi Elves of the desert oases of Osirion and nearby lands, Vourinoi are often unknown to any but those travelers and nomads who pass by a Vourinoi oasis, but the few who encounter these elves find them a gregarious and welcoming people. The oasis elves know how inimical to life their homes can be, and they eagerly welcome and mingle with travelers in need of water and shelter. Vourinoi learn almost from birth to be charming, eloquent, and hospitable, and when conflict arises, most would rather talk than fight.",
				"Vourinoi are easily identified by their rich brown skin and black hair, though individual elves might have vivid blue, green, or white hair.",
				"Vourinoi consider themselves separate from the nations they occupy, and their friendliness belies a deep and fierce independence. Given their reputation for skill at both magic and desert warfare, the rulers of the desert lands have little desire to infringe upon the elves' homes. In addition, the Vourinoi consider themselves the sole stewards of their oases, and any attempt to control or corrupt the life-giving sites draws the elves' fury. Despite their love for their homes, Vourinoi also share a great sense of wanderlust, even by elven standards. Like their patron goddess Desna, the oasis elves delight in traveling where whim takes them and meeting new people, and many leave their homes to wander for many years before returning to their oasis. Vourinoi are especially fond of visiting their Mualijae cousins in the Mwangi Expanse, and vice versa.",
				"Vourinoi have a loose relationship with gender, and many exist outside of binary gender or move among genders as their feelings take them, an identity they refer to as kala-shei, or, \"the dance.\" Many Vourinoi also believe in the elven philosophy known as the Brightness, a belief that their current life is but one in a series, and that upon death they are reincarnated as another creature. Searching for one's Brightness\u2014a beautiful, ecstatic moment of enlightenment leading them to a higher destiny\u2014is a common goal in their wanderings.",
				"Vourinoi elves often have the desert elf heritage (see below). Their vibrant personalities and fluid philosophies often lead them to take the Elven Verve feat (page 26)",
				"Heritages The following heritages are available to elves.",
				"Ancient Elf In your long life, you've dabbled in many paths and many styles. Choose a class other than your own. You gain the multiclass dedication feat for that class, even though you don't meet its level prerequisite. You must still meet its other prerequisites to gain the feat.",
				"Desert Elf You live under the desert's blazing heat, gaining incredible resilience to warm environments. You gain fire resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1), and environmental heat effects are one step less extreme for you (incredible heat becomes extreme, extreme heat becomes severe, and so on)",
				"MUALIJAE The Mualijae were once part of a powerful united kingdom, but the people split into three different nations in ancient times for reasons unknown.",
				"Alijae: Located in the northern Mwangi jungles, Alijae defend the elven ruins of Nagisa, the White City, for reasons unknown\u2014perhaps due to a darkness within the Alijae themselves.",

This never causes you to change to an elf heritage that isn't related to an environment, such as ancient elf, seer elf, or whisper elf.",
				"THE FORLORN While elves have a love of friendship and laughter, they are known to keep shorter-lived people at a carefully calculated distance, fearing the inevitable pain of watching a friend age and rapidly die. To live entirely among non-elves is considered a terrible fate, as an elf would see everyone they know and love wither away, only for the same tragedy to repeat less than a century later. For this reason, elves who live entirely among humans or other shorter-lived people are called Forlorn.",
				"Gnomes Millennia ago, gnomes were among the many fey creatures cavorting about the First World, a realm of abundant light, life, and remorseless fancy. However, a long-forgotten event led to many gnomes' {@condition fleeing} from their ancestral home.",
				"Banished to a world bound by cause and effect and physical limitations, the gnomes of Golarion struggled to adapt\u2014not just to find food and shelter, but to retain their identity and supernatural grip on life. With their connection to the First World severed, gnomes began withering slowly, bleeding their color, curiosity, and vitality in a process known as the Bleaching. Only by engaging in new and wondrous experiences can gnomes sustain their minds and stave off this ancestral curse, recapturing just enough of the whimsy of their lost homeland to survive\u2014and even thrive.",
				"Although the Material Plane initially seemed lethally drab by comparison to the First World, gnomes have adapted to their new environment. In addition to their natural curiosity and creativity driving them to explore every possible niche available, gnome infants form innate connections to the supernatural features that suffuse their surroundings. Like dry sponges, gnomes absorb elements of arcane, divine, occult, or primal magic, partially filling the voids left from the absence of their connection to the First World.",
				"These energies also shape a young gnome's features, coloration, personality, and innate magic, often causing children to diverge dramatically from their parents' natures based on where they grew up. Thanks to gnomes' penchants for traveling, the majority of any gnome community can share a number of physiological traits while still having a motley assortment of appearances.",
				"Individual gnomes' appearance span the full range of human eye, skin, and hair colorations and beyond, including shades of green, blue, pink, purple, and other hues. The color of these features are most vibrant early in a gnome's life, growing slightly more subdued with age.",
				"The need for novelty drives many of a gnome's actions. Periods of idleness are harmless and even refreshing, yet weeks, months, or years without some goal, project, or other stimulus to fuel a gnome's imagination leaves them vulnerable to the dreaded Bleaching. Whereas on the First World, any energy lost would quickly be replaced by that plane's ubiquitous wonders, on the Material Plane, a gnome's innate magic gradually seeps into their surroundings in a losing battle, much as a warm body inevitably loses heat in cold weather.",
				"Most gnomes can't perceive this transfer as anything other than additional anxiety or stress. Engagement and activity cause a gnome to generate enough magic to counteract this loss, but once a gnome's succumbed too far, the final stages of the Bleaching drain their remaining color over a span of several years. The process is painful and typically lethal, though a tiny fraction survives to become so-called Bleachlings, strangely calm and pale gnomes that most other gnomes view with fearful respect.",
				"Thanks to their natural curiosity, sharp senses, stubborn resourcefulness, and sheer tenacity, gnomes make natural adventurers who thrive in a variety of roles. Combined with their long lifespans, gnomes often accumulate an eclectic array of semipractical skills that can prove unexpectedly useful, and few develop the same depths of expertise in esoteric subjects as gnomes.",
				"FIRST WORLD GNOMES Hundreds of generations and nearly 10,000 years separate Material Plane gnomes from their First World homeland, yet many gnomes remained in the fey realm. There they have retained an especially strong primal connection and are themselves fey\u2014they constitute one of the most numerous and adaptable of the First World's residents. Whereas on that plane they can be reborn again and again, on the Material Plane they are at risk of permanent death\u2014a fact that perturbs them as much as their alien and immutable surroundings.",
				"Gnomes of the Inner Sea Gnomes do not have traditional ethnicities as humans might categorize them. The prevailing magical forces of an area shape gnomes' appearances and dispositions as much as conventional genetics do. As a result, a region's gnomes drift toward common traits that are largely independent of actual lineage. In some cases, these shared features happen to overlap closely with those of other major humanoid populations\u2014for example, the gnomes of Katapesh and Nex tend to have skin and hair reminiscent of their Keleshite and Garundi neighbors\u2014while in others, gnomes' bright features or uncommon complexions set them apart from everyone else.",
				"Gnomes' penchant for experimentation and innovation also means their culture is constantly changing. Cherished traditions are as likely to be centuries old as they are to have been fashioned the previous year, and the shifting of a settlement's composition regularly upsets any academic understanding of that population's customs. What's more, gnomes often adopt local conventions, often for the simple reason of bringing variety to their own routines. Even so, there are just enough cultural similarities among gnomes of common backgrounds that they can still be categorized into ethnographic groups: fell gnomes, Feychild gnomes, glimmer gnomes, and Keenspark gnomes.",
				"Nearly every gnome's top priority is staving off the Bleaching. This survivalist urge is less an immediate goal as it is an inspiration for how gnomes approach their lives. Many seek out the most wondrous experiences they can, periodically uprooting and pursuing some exciting opportunity in another land. Other gnomes find depth and meaning in a craft, study, or profession, ever seeking new discoveries and minutiae to keep their minds engaged. There's an irony that gnomes often relish particularly dangerous jobs as a way of staying in good health. This often drives gnomes to become adventurers, not just to overcome constant danger, but also to see new lands and meet eclectic companions.",
				"Unlike halflings, who often blend into other societies, gnomes thrive when standing out, from attracting the type of trouble that makes for a good story later to establishing credentials so that they may be recognized for their achievements.",
				"As a result, gnomes are often polarizing. A magnet for mischief might be endearing to some but frustrating to others, and tales of gnome tricksters both capture the imagination and fuel misconceptions held by members of other ancestries. Dwarves are often quick to view gnome behaviors\u2014particularly the iconoclastic antics of Feychild gnomes\u2014as a threat to dwarven traditions, even while dwarves and gnomes often bond over their shared adoration of good craftsmanship. Elves' shared longevity and appreciation for the natural world often help them connect with gnomes. Because halflings, half-orcs, half-elves, and goblins lack true homelands of their own, gnomes often find common ground with these peoples while exploring the world, discovering niches where they can thrive and adopting trusted comrades as surrogate families.",
				"Bleachlings Those gnomes with the debatable fortune to survive the Bleaching awaken as Bleachlings, pale reflections of their former selves {@condition drained} of color and strong emotion. Despite the fearful stigma that most gnomes have for Bleachlings, the latter seem utterly at peace with their new condition. If anything, Bleachlings are attuned to nature in a way that exceeds their brethren's natural affinity, speaking to animals with ease and reaching a magical equilibrium with their surroundings.",
				"Fell Gnomes While light and laughter suffuse much of the First World, the plane is also home to more sinister fey of blood, spite, and shadows. When gnomes come of age near an area of darker magical forces, their physiology seems to SPRIGGANS In the earliest days of their exile, some gnomes didn't just fight their draining magic; they actively siphoned their environment's magic\u2014absorbing even local curses and corruption. After generations of such vampirism, these so-called spriggans have become bitter and territorial, convinced that these are the necessary steps for survival in a harsh and alien world. For this reason, gnomes call spriggans the Lonely Ones.",
				"SVIRFNEBLINS Gnomes are not the only fey to have reached the Material Plane. Among the exiled gnomes, those that became svirfneblins\u2014also known as deep gnomes\u2014saw old enemies like gremlins, redcaps, bogeymen, and worse infest the underground realms. Rather than let these tricksters run rampant, some gnomes followed deep below the earth.",
				"Svirfneblins stave off the Bleaching by focusing on a different obsession: stewardship of their subterranean home.",
				"absorb some of these foreboding elements as if activating some recessive genes. Known as fell gnomes, these children boast eerily exaggerated features, such as spindly fingers, too-wide grins, and exaggerated eyes. Fell gnomes also tend to favor dark humor that thoroughly disquiets bystanders, particularly when combined with chilling magic that shatters preconceptions that gnomes are inherently bright creatures.",
				"Though fell gnomes are not intrinsically cruel or morose, many enjoy leveraging their disquieting characteristics in social settings. To this end, fell gnomes often favor darker colors, asymmetrical clothing, and imposing garments. Fell gnomes often reside near occult nexuses, such as those found in Cheliax, Druma, and Ustalav.",
				"Fell gnomes often have the umbral gnome or wellspring gnome (occult) heritage, though the sensate gnome and chameleon gnome heritages are also common.",
				"Feychild Gnomes Most numerous of the gnomes, Feychild gnomes also have the strongest connection to their ancestral homeland, the First World. Having developed a bond to a mighty natural feature or primal source, these gnomes are the most likely to display naturally bright and fantastic features\u2014including bright hair and eyes that include yellow, green, orange, blue, and pink hues, among others\u2014and tend toward tan, pale, or green skin.",
				"Despite having the most natural magical foundation, these gnomes' fey connection is considered the least stable and most in need of stimulus. As a result, Feychild gnomes are often capricious and emotive, regularly seeking new experiences, playing pranks, and fueling countless gnome stereotypes.",
				"However, their intense First World connection also often grants Feychild gnomes a rapport with animals and plants, ensuring they never want for friends. Elves usually respect these gnomes' fey aspect, albeit often through a somewhat paternalistic lens.",
				"Feychild gnomes are most common in Andoran, the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, the Mwangi Expanse, and the River Kingdoms.",
				"Feychild gnomes frequently have the fey-touched gnome heritage, though some gnomes express their connection to the First World with the chameleon gnome, sensate gnome, or vivacious gnome heritages.",
				"Glimmer Gnomes Golarion is a tapestry of divine scars where the gods have made their marks through cataclysms and miracles, and these sites retain a magical resonance that shapes nearby gnome populations.",
				"This world-shattering power combines with gnomes' ancestral First World origins to grant the gnomes a degree of influence over existence itself. These glimmer gnomes (a corruption of the original name \"glamour gnomes\") possess a natural talent for illusion and reality-warping magic, sometimes causing bystanders to mistake them for godlings\u2014or members of the Eldest\u2014in their own right.",
				"It's an easy mistake to make, given these gnomes' slightly translucent hair that seems to glow in the light and the warm, metallic irises of their eyes. Most perturbing of all, though, is a glimmer gnome's penchant for appearing and disappearing unpredictably, like mischievous tricksters who always seem to emerge or vanish at the most advantageous times.",
				"Glimmer gnomes are most common where there are powerful religious connections. Small groups are associated with Nidal's obedience to Zon‑Kuthon, Osirion's reverence of Nethys, and Casmaron's accursed Pit of Gormuz where Rovagug is sealed.",
				"A significant population of these gnomes have ties to Absalom's Starstone GNOME ENCLAVES Due to their haphazard diaspora from the First World and a drive to explore, gnomes have dispersed widely.",
				"Populations gravitate to wherever there are exciting opportunities, powerful sources of supernatural energy, or both.",
				"The following pages describe popular gnome enclaves.",
				"BRASTLEWARK Believed one of the largest gnome settlements on Golarion, Brastlewark in eastern Cheliax is home to thousands of alchemists, engineers, inventors, and scientists. The restless ingenuity causes Brastlewark's architecture to change a little every day, reinventing the city's skyline every few years. Although Chelaxian officials view Brastlewark with some disdain, the city is a prodigious exporter of spell components, alchemical tools, and potions.",
				"Cathedral, where their population is evenly split between gnomes who play up their divinely inspired origins through extravagant clothing and those who resent visitors' fawning admiration and dress to avoid undue attention.",
				"Many glimmer gnomes have the chameleon gnome, vivacious gnome, or wellspring gnome (divine) heritage.",
				"Keenspark Gnomes Some gnomes aren't content to soak in the world's wonders; they possess an especially strong drive to create their own. Dedicated to innovation, Keenspark gnomes regularly prod at the edges of reality and possibility alike, not only inventing strange devices and pioneering new magical theories, but also challenging long-held beliefs and religious assumptions. As a result, these iconoclasts and innovators are the gnomes most likely to come across as perfectionistic, dismissive, controlling, or outright irritating, leading to their gnome kin jokingly referring to them as \"sour gnomes.\" However, their knowledge is a boon in a wide variety of fields, and Keenspark gnomes are among the foremost wizards, engineers, philosophers, and craftspeople.",
				"Compared to their colorful kin, Keenspark gnomes have comparably drab skin, hair, and eye coloration that closely mirrors common human hues.",
				"These gnomes are most common in areas of intense arcane innovation or utter eldritch devastation. As a result, Nex and the Mana Wastes are home to substantial populations of Keenspark gnomes, particularly in Quantium's laboratories. Likewise, Absalom's arcane universities attract and shape a healthy Keenspark population. Perhaps more oddly, Rahadoum's small gnome population is overwhelmingly Keenspark in nature, perhaps due to the country's longstanding rebuke of divine influence.",
				"Keenspark gnomes usually have the wellspring gnome (arcane) heritage, though some who work in fields that favor the senses instead have the sensate gnome heritage.",
				"Heritage The following heritage is available to gnomes.",

Despite its relative isolation, the inhabitants are avid opera fans and cultural connoisseurs.",
				"The town works closely with local druids, and gnomes here often learn to command primal magic of their own.",
				"Goblins Goblins legends claim that the first goblins on Golarion were born from the human blood spilled by the barghests Hadregash, Venkelvore, Zarongel, and Zogmugot. Each of these barghests gave the goblins a gift to help them prosper. From Hadregash came the gift of tribe, making goblins stronger in numbers. Venkelvore gave goblins a bottomless hunger that drove them to spread out across the world. Zarongel, the most bestial of the barghests, granted an affinity to the predators who shared the goblins' inclinations, such as goblin dogs and wolves, so that goblins excelled at riding these creatures and could fight and travel more quickly. Finally, Zogmugot taught the goblins the secrets of the shores, how to scrounge, fish, and seek, so they could scavenge and survive no matter where they found themselves.",
				"Over time, goblins spread across Golarion, and today they can be found across the Inner Sea region, from the sweltering jungles of Mediogalti Island to the frozen and blighted forests of Iobaria. Goblins have even found homes on the distant continents of Arcadia and Tian Xia, their clever instinct for survival allowing them to thrive even in the most {@condition hostile} of environments. In fact, goblins are no strangers to hostility; whether bullied by and recruited as disposable shock troops for their larger hobgoblin and bugbear kin or mercilessly wiped out by adventurers who see them as little more than pests to be exterminated, goblin lives are, more often than not, short and full of hardship.",
				"Despite the overwhelmingly negative perception most other peoples have of goblins, the small people have begun to find places among other societies, primarily in human cities and towns. While cities like Magnimar have long tolerated the goblin tribes that occupy their sewers, viewing them as a convenient cleaning service preventing disease-bearing rats or dangerous otyughs from proliferating, there are more and more areas where goblins can walk openly on the streets without fear of being skewered by guards or {@condition frightened} farmers. On the sun-scorched streets of Katapesh, a tribe of Rasp goblins maintain a thriving mercantile enterprise under the leadership of an elderly goblin known by the name Yigrig Moneymaker. Operating in the northern lands of Irrisen, the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, and even the southern edge of the Crown of the World, a band of frost goblins recruited by the Pathfinder {@skill Society} acts as a team of scouts and guides for the {@skill Society}'s members and allies. In the land of Sarkoris, a cunning tribe of forest goblins fights alongside a tribe of Sarkorian refugees looking to reclaim their homeland from the demons and monsters that infest it. Goblin arsonists are proclaimed heroes and allies by human generals as goblin‑brewed alchemical fires sear the undead forces crawling forth from the Eye of Dread.",
				"Even goblin cutpurses scrounging their living in alleys find themselves recruited by enterprising adventurers who recognize the value of an alliance with a clever sneak whose survival instincts have been honed by untold generations of hardship and persecution. Their means and circumstances vary greatly, but goblins across Golarion have begun to carve a niche for themselves where they can be accepted.",
				"Goblins of the Inner Sea To outsiders, it might seem like goblins are all part of a single, monolithic people, but like any other ancestry, goblins have a variety of ethnicities and cultures nearly as diverse as the territories CROOKEDTOES Members of the Crookedtoes forest goblin tribe often take up the adventurer's mantle. The Crookedtoes' migrations have taken them from the Chitterwood in Isger to the Fangwood on the southern border of Lastwall, and finally to Absalom. In the city at the center of the world, the Crookedtoes occupy the Puddles district as valued allies of the Knights of Lastwall, as the two groups fought alongside one another during the harried evacuation of Lastwall. One of these goblins, Zusgut, served as the lord of Lastwall's aide-de-camp and has now declared himself \"the Goblin King of Absalom.\" they occupy. Certain aspects of goblin culture, such as a penchant for song, an overzealous appreciation of fire, fear of dogs and horses, and an instinctive distrust of literacy and the written word, are common across all goblin cultures, but these represent only the most superficial elements of goblin life.",
				"Forest Goblins Hailing from coniferous woodlands, forest goblins tend to be shorter and slimmer than their kin, not quite reaching 3 feet in height and rarely weighing more than 35 pounds. Forest goblins typically have skin ranging in hue from dark green to a sickly green-tinged brown reminiscent of a spoiled avocado. While all goblins have a natural tendency toward pyromania, forest goblins are often far more knowledgeable on the subject than almost any other species. Since forest goblins traditionally produce far fewer primal or divine spellcasters than other goblin ethnicities, they have developed a deep tradition of fire-management practices, taught through song and practical application. There is even evidence to suggest that woodlands inhabited by forest goblins are less {@condition prone} to disastrous wildfires thanks to the goblins regularly burning away dead wood and dry brush that might otherwise act as fuel for hungry flames.",
				"Forest goblins are often reclusive and avoid contact with members of other ancestries except when pilfering or scavenging from camps and caravans that pass near their territory, but some exceptions do exist. In 4697 ar, the forest goblins who inhabited Isger's Chitterwood were recruited into a series of brutal conflicts now known as the Goblinblood Wars, resulting in one of the bloodiest conflicts in Isger's troubled history. Of more auspicious note, the Crookedtoes and Dragondweller tribes have both recently provided critical assistance to human nations, earning them the patronage and protection of powerful allies.",
				"Most forest goblins have the treedweller goblin heritage (page 37), though their frequent exposure to flame means some forest goblins favor the charhide goblin heritage. Due to their extensive practice of teaching songs, forest goblins also frequently take the {@feat Goblin Song} ancestry feat.",
				"Frost Goblins Born in Irrisen's eternal winter, frost goblins are well adapted to surviving in frigid environments. Frost goblins' skin is adapted to help them blend in and survive in arctic environments, ranging in color from a light ice-blue to the dark blue-gray of stormy northern oceans. While most goblins are almost universally hairless, frost goblins occasionally sport blue fur similar in texture and density to that of their bugbear cousins.",
				"The Frostfur tribe of goblins, originally hailing from Irrisen, are among the most notable tribes of frost goblins due to their association with the Pathfinder {@skill Society}. Originally recruited as pawns by rebel factions within the {@skill Society}, the Frostfur have since served as scouts and guides for several Pathfinder expeditions. While few of the Frostfur goblins have chosen to become full members of the Pathfinder {@skill Society} due to their rambunctious nature and distrust of literacy, they remain steadfast allies and word of their loyalty is spreading. This burgeoning reputation means that frost goblins are, if not precisely well liked or welcomed, at least able to travel, buy goods, and secure lodging in most areas with a Pathfinder presence free of harassment. In the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, Venture‑Captain Bjersig Torrsen keeps the few frost goblins who have made their homes at his lodge in Iceferry busy carrying messages, guiding archaeological expeditions into the frozen wastes, and performing any other task he can find to keep the energetic beings gainfully occupied and safely FROSTFUR The Frostfur goblins of Irrisen have taken many casualties since their initial contact with the Pathfinder {@skill Society}, but the resilient creatures seem to replenish their ranks as quickly as they are diminished. Pathfinder Venture‑Captains have begun to note that Frostfur goblins sent on scouting and reconnaissance missions frequently return with more goblins than left on the original missions, despite consistently reporting losses due to monsters, traps, environmental hazards, and accidental wand or alchemical item discharges. When asked about these new frost goblins, the most common response is simply \"Frostfur is Frostfur.\" Whether that means the new goblin recruits are scattered members of the tribe discovered on the expedition or unrelated frost goblins who simply followed their kin back to the lodge is currently unclear, though the sheer number of frost goblins currently operating within the {@skill Society}'s ranks combined with those reported lost or deceased on missions seems to indicate that the Frostfurs are actively recruiting other frost goblins they encounter.",
				"away from his dog, a powerful husky named Mahki, whose relationship with the Frostfurs is adversarial at best.",
				"Frost goblins almost always have the snow goblin heritage, and they frequently take the {@feat Goblin Scuttle} ancestry feat due to their frenzied energy and surprisingly coordinated teamwork.",
				"Monkey Goblins Monkey goblins originated on Mediogalti Island, where their distinctive tails give them a significant advantage in the dense jungles. These goblins are taller and heavier than other goblins, standing a bit over 3-1/2 feet tall and weighing between 50 and 60 pounds. Their skin spans the range from tawny bronze to dark blue, and gold eyes are more common than the red eyes of their kin.",
				"While monkey goblins have some of the most obvious physical differences compared to their tailless cousins, their love of fire is just as strong and just as likely to end in conflagration or disaster. As monkey goblins have historically made their dwellings in treetop abodes, ferocious canopy fires and high mortality rates have kept the curious and capable beings from spreading into the wider world in any significant numbers. Despite the challenges monkey goblins face in just surviving their own antics, there are some monkey goblins who pursue lives of adventure, whether as valued members of a ship's crew (some of whom actively seek out monkey goblins to crew the rigging and crow's nest on their ship, so long as they can keep the goblins from accidentally setting the sails on fire) or as members of small teams of adventurers or treasure-seekers.",
				"Monkey goblins almost always have the tailed goblin heritage (page 37)",
				"Monkey goblins who travel on pirate or merchant ships often take the {@feat Goblin Scuttle} ancestry feat, since they're accustomed to the frantic scrambling of shipboard combat.",
				"Rasp Goblins Rasp goblins, or simply \"Rasps,\" named after the section of Varisia's Lost Coast where they tend to live, are some of the most commonly encountered goblins in the Inner Sea region, particularly in Varisia and the neighboring nations. Unlike frost goblins and monkey goblins, who are limited to smaller geographic areas, and forest goblins, who suffered terrible population losses during the Goblinblood Wars, Rasp goblins remain exceptionally populous and can quickly spread to any area that is vaguely capable of sustaining life. Rasp goblins stand just over 3 feet tall and weigh roughly 35 pounds. While many Rasp goblins are some shade of green (typically lighter and sicklier shades than their forest goblin cousins), some Rasp goblins have rarer skin colors, such as gray or purple.",
				"Rasp goblins have inhabited the southern and western reaches of Varisia for longer than any of the country's human inhabitants, resulting in frequent conflict as humans push deeper and deeper into the goblins' ancestral territory. Encounters with particularly aggressive and malevolent goblin communities mean that pioneer towns like Sandpoint often view goblins as little more than dangerous pests, and hire guards and adventurers to drive off any nearby goblins out of a sense of public safety. As a result, though their population numbers remain somewhat stable, Rasp goblins rarely have anything resembling clan GANDA-UJ The treetop city of Ganda-Uj is the closest thing the monkey goblins of Mediogalti Island have to a capital and homeland, but there's little sense of history or culture within its shady boughs. The current Ganda-Uj is at least the fifth location to bear the name, the previous Ganda-Ujs having been burned so completely that new growth still struggles to retake the scorched earth where they once stood. While monkey goblins themselves can be of any alignment, non-evil monkey goblins tend to have even shorter lifespans than their neighbors in Ganda-Uj, as the demon worship prevalent in that community encourages frequent slaughter. Those monkey goblins who are not willing participants in these demonic rites often find themselves serving as the chosen sacrifice, leading non‑evil monkey goblins to eagerly seek opportunities to travel as far away from their kin as they can, preferably as fast as possible.",
				"elders or even anyone in their communities with more than a few years of knowledge or experience. This in turn means that the teaching songs goblins traditionally use to pass on their lore and skills are largely lost to the Rasp goblin tribes, who retain little more than war songs and death chants. Their aversion to literacy and lack of elders has lead to many Rasp goblins living and {@condition dying} in a state of perpetual childhood, which\u2014perhaps due to the frequent conflicts between Rasp goblin tribes and other peoples\u2014has led to the spread of a number of unfortunate stereotypes not only about Rasp goblins, but about all goblins, such as the assertion that all goblins are bloodthirsty raiders, murderers, and Lamashtu worshippers.",

				"Halflings For as long as there have been humans in the Inner Sea region, there have been halflings nearby\u2014small, quick, keen-eyed people only half as tall as humans and determined to construct an easy life in the shadows of larger people. Halflings are known for luck and bravery that overshadow their humble size. Although many halflings make their livings as traders or storytellers, most prefer to stay safely in the background. They enjoy being useful to others\u2014and to their own families in particular\u2014but they generally dislike receiving public accolades for their efforts.",
				"Halflings in the Inner Sea region tend to share communities with members of taller ancestries, and quite a few halflings live in cities with their extended families. Young halflings are {@condition prone} to wanderlust, however, and often strike out on their own across the land with little other than the few coins they've scraped together, a lucky memento or two, and their irrepressible personalities.",
				"These young halflings are lean and quick, and most are, by human standards, a little bit larcenous in their habits. This inclination to thievery doesn't arise from inherent greed; instead, halflings love lighthearted mischief and also tend to have more communal notions of property. Most halflings simply pick up a tool or bauble when it's useful and return it once they're done with it, though halflings are quick to return an item or pay for a replacement to the best of their ability if asked.",
				"Older or more established halflings may take on supporting positions in a community, working as valets, shopkeepers, or artisans, but they retain their keen senses, deft fingers, and cheery outlook even as they age. Older halflings often enjoy doting on younger ones, passing down tools, weapons, and stories, and family bonds among halflings are particularly strong.",
				"Halflings place an inordinate amount of trust in their inherent luck, which neighbors view with amazement and slight envy. Most halflings have so many lucky breaks in their lives\u2014minor scrapes from would-be deadly falls, unseen arrows missing their mark, or serendipitous meetings in a busy city\u2014that they rarely even remark upon them. Halflings rely on their good fortune to always be there to support them, and fortune rarely disappoints them for long. Halflings consider luck a personal attribute, like height or hair color, and many conclude that their surfeit offsets their smaller size. Many halflings like to collect items they consider lucky, such as berries and buttons, and are a bit unnerved by unlucky portents, such as birds of prey and splintered wood.",
				"Halfling adventurers in the Inner Sea region are usually younger halflings who haven't yet settled down, although tragedy might send an older halfling into the world to rebuild her fortune or recover a lost legacy. The former are likely to be bards, fighters, rogues, or sorcerers, while the latter might be alchemists, clerics, or wizards. In any case, halflings are brave and affable folk who enjoy keeping the spirits of their adventuring companions high.",
				"Halflings of the Inner Sea The halflings of the Inner Sea region primarily developed alongside the people around them. Halflings living alongside other ancestries soon mimicked these groups in more than just cultures and traditions. These halflings developed into cultures and ethnicities that were distinctly halfling, yet quite similar to those of the other peoples with whom they shared their lives. Many halfling ethnicities are thus close reflections of other ancestries' ethnicities, with halflings sharing the same physiology and cultural traditions of their compatriots, who are often humans.",
				"However, even as halflings grew alongside other ancestries, some lived independent lives and developed cultures all their own.",
				"THE BELLFLOWER NETWORK An organization devoted to smuggling halfling slaves to safety, the Bellflower Network operates primarily in Cheliax.",
				"Halfling slaves support and shelter Bellflower agents when possible, and it speaks volumes to halfling camaraderie that so many of them turn down a chance at personal freedom to become Bellflower agents themselves. Chelaxian halflings in particular have to be adaptable due to their circumstances, but many of these halfling agents prefer classes suited to stealth, such as bard and rogue.",
				"Chelaxians Halflings have long been slaves in Cheliax, where they are forced to labor in occupations that exploit their keen eyes and quick fingers to produce quick profits for their overseers, such as textile production or orchard picking. Others serve as household slaves, often as cooks or valets; these slaves typically are required to perform less arduous tasks but suffer frequent abuse and dreadful personal accommodations, as when forced to sleep in cupboards. In Cheliax, halflings are derisively called \"slips,\" and their cramped slave quarters are called \"slip kennels.\" Legal punishments for beating, mutilating, or killing a halfling in Cheliax are appallingly light and classified as property crimes, even when perpetrated against the nation's few free halflings.",
				"Halflings in Cheliax often band together for protection, such as by working hard to cover for a sick comrade or sharing the burden of an unfair punishment.",
				"Halflings take joy in spending time with family, even when they live as slaves, and their desire to protect their family members is, unfortunately, something cruel overseers learn to exploit. A halfling slave who betrays another for personal gain is labeled an \"impkin\" among them and earns a reputation so tainted that most impkin are essentially ostracized by all other halflings.",
				"Jarics Jarics are boisterous halflings who live {@condition hidden} among the Barrier Wall mountains of northern Garund. Their rugged lifestyle among the peaks has shaped their features. Their skin is deeply tanned and weathered from spending most of their lives outdoors, and their bodies are slightly shorter and stockier compared to other halflings. Jarics are particularly muscular due to traversing the cliffs and rock walls of the Barrier Wall. This prowess steers Jarics toward more physical pursuits such as combat, with many Jaric children growing up wrestling one another for fun. The rough nature of their endeavors leaves many Jarics with black eyes or scars, something they wear with pride. Jarics sport dark brown eyes and darker hair colors, such as black and brown. They enjoy adopting bombastic hair styles and\u2014among men\u2014impressive facial hair. Jarics tend to wear loose-fitting clothing that permits a wide range of physical movement, although they prefer to eschew clothing altogether when doing so won't make their neighbors uncomfortable.",
				"Jaric society is a scattered thing, with most Jarics forming small groups and tribes on their own respective mountains. These groups usually number in the dozens, though some reach into the hundreds. These groups usually form hunting and gathering parties, moving across the peaks as they require to survive, with some groups keeping closer to the base of mountains where food and game are more plentiful. Though most Jaric tribes remain mobile, they do maintain a few settlements, most notably the halfling city of Limani in the central Barrier Wall. The city is a hub for thousands of Jaric halflings and is known for its seasonal festivals where Jarics trade food, stories, and blows in the name of {@condition friendly} competition.",
				"Like-minded Jarics in a community often join together in {@condition friendly}, lively groups called bill-bands. A bill-band is a cross between a club and a gang, and most have pugnacious names like \"Winkle's Freedom Fighters\" or \"Futharc's First Fist.\" Although many bill-bands are groups of swaggering bravos who come together for sparring, sports, or similar pursuits, others form to engage in spirited debates and create collaborative art pieces.",
				"Mihrinis In the distant region of Iobaria, just east of Avistan, live the Mihrini halflings. These halflings developed among the colder climates of the region and have a unique appearance, with sharper chins and wider ears. They are also thinner than most halflings. Their skin is often pale, though some darker JARIC ADVENTURERS Although Jarics tend to keep to their homes among the mountains, they are not afraid to travel out across Golarion as they see fit. Typically, Jarics choose to leave life among the mountains to challenge themselves, both physically and mentally, though many Jarics set out into the world due to curiosity alone. At times, entire bill-bands set out together, creating natural adventuring parties. Many Jaric halflings become champions, fighters, or monks.",
				"tones appear among Mihrinis, especially those living in the River Kingdoms.",
				"Most Mihrini halflings have long, fine hair that grows black with white streaks or vice-versa, and they cannot grow facial hair. In addition, the hair on their feet tends to be finer and lighter than that of other halflings. Eye colors among Mihrinis tend to be on the lighter side, with blues and grays being most common. Mihrinis prefer many-layered clothing, particularly garments with several buttons in different styles and textures. Many keep their hair long and loose when not out of place in the local culture, save for small braids close to the scalp that are {@condition hidden} by hair or a hood.",
				"Unfortunately, Mihrini culture is not what it once was. The Choking Plague in Iobaria thinned the numbers of Mihrini halflings over five centuries ago, and the population never truly recovered. The Mihrini survivors soon scattered throughout Iobaria and beyond, partly in hopes of escaping the constant plagues in the region. Today, many Mihrinis live along the eastern edge of Avistan, particularly near Brevoy, Galt, and the River Kingdoms.",
				"Mihrini halflings move in large tribes and are typically a nomadic people, uprooting at the first sign of possible disaster. These tribes maintain few written records and instead keep oral histories, telling tales from previous homes and lessons learned from previous dangers.",
				"Due to the constant, unpredictable movement throughout their lives, many Mihrinis are predisposed to an anxious disposition. To help stay at ease or remain occupied, many Mihrinis keep a small piece of sturdy string in a pocket or tied around a wrist. Called a hallinette, this string gives the halfling something to keep the fingers occupied, whether in tying or re-tying knots, arranging complicated loops, or even simply twisting it among the fingers.",
				"Othobans With the return of Xin-Edasseril and the rise of New Thassilon near Varisia came a number of Thassilonian people displaced from time. Among these were a small population of Othoban halflings. These halflings lived in ancient Thassilon and were the precursors to many of the halflings that live in Varisia today. Their displacement preserved their unique traits, such as their range of skin tones from pale to dusky. Othoban hair is typically wavy, with colors as varied as their skin, though they are unable to grow facial hair except for thin sideburns. Much like other Thassilonians, Othobans like to wear the latest styles and enjoy having multiple outfits to choose from, often overspending on clothing. However, even Othobans of limited means keep a few welltended articles of clothing they can mix and match to create different looks, and they frequently share clothing with their neighbors\u2014whether their neighbors appreciate it or not.",
				"As Othobans are now stepping into a new and strange world, many of them are doing their best to learn about the new time in which they live, pursuing new, exciting, or pleasing sensory experiences. They seek out a variety of local cultures, enjoying as many different variations of art, food, and pageants as their means allow. Many Othobans also thirst for knowledge and delve into reading. These Othobans collect stories, whether from books they've read or tales they've heard in their travels, and spend time contemplating disparate stories to discover common themes. The excitable nature of these Othobans sometimes makes it difficult to keep up with them in conversation, as the halflings continually and energetically jump from topic to topic.",
				"Song'o Many halflings live in the Mwangi Expanse, but few are as reclusive as the Song'o halflings of the Laughing Jungle. Unlike most halflings, who adopt the culture of the humanoids near them, Song'o halflings are reclusive and keep their own traditions. Already cautious due to the prevalent dangers of their jungle home, the Chelaxian establishment of the former colony of MIHRINI ADVENTURERS As Mihrini communities are constantly on the move, individual halflings are already accustomed to an adventuring lifestyle and gravitate toward setting out into Golarion. Some of these Mihrinis merely seek a new home and a comfortable life, while others find adventuring to be a useful tool to overcome their own anxieties. As many Mihrini halflings are natural storytellers, and their deft fingers are suited to the complicated somatic movements necessary for spellcasting or thievery, they make excellent bards, rogues, sorcerers, and wizards.",
				"Sargava taught the Song'o to distrust and flee from outsiders. Today, with the overthrow of that government and the founding of Vidrian, Song'o are just beginning to explore beyond their own communities once more. They still distrust unfamiliar people, prefer to stay out of sight and observe their surroundings, and readily uproot their temporary villages and relocate to new regions deeper in the jungle if they suspect danger is nearby.",
				"Because of their skittishness and reluctance to interact with others, Song'o halflings preserve a rich and ancient culture that developed in isolation in the Laughing Jungle. They enjoy fleeting art, such as music made with impromptu items, or sculptures of earth and leaves. Song'o halflings share the dark skin of their Mwangi human neighbors, with black or dark-brown eyes and dark, curly hair. Most Song'o halflings like to paint their bodies, especially their faces, and they enjoy showing off their designs to others, although they are reluctant to compliment even skillful work because they think compliments bring bad luck. They are very fond of flowers and use them to adorn their homes, wagons, and clothing. Song'o halflings wear multiple layers of patterned clothing when possible, with stories about how each layer provides protection from predators, insects, or weather. From a practical standpoint, however, these layers must be lightweight so the halflings don't overheat in their warm jungle; their gauzy but resilient clothing is particularly prized by the few traders who have befriended Song'o halflings. They don't tend toward any particular class, but usually have the Wildwood halfling heritage.",
				"Uhlams Among the depths of the Verduran Forest live Uhlam halflings. These halflings have lived in and around the forest for centuries, enjoying simple lives. Uhlam skin tones range from pale for those who live within the forest to tan tones for those living on the fringes. Most Uhlams are somewhat squat and heavier compared to other halflings. They tend to have hair mostly of lighter tones like blonde, brown, and red, and most Uhlams have trouble growing much facial hair, though sideburns are common. Uhlam eye colors have a wide spectrum including more common colors like blues, browns, and greens to more vibrant coloration like lavender and dark yellow. Uhlam halflings tend to keep their hair short and enjoy simple, functional clothing that is useful and reliable.",
				"Such clothing tends to have several flaps and pockets, each containing some useful tool, bit of food, or other sundry item.",
				"The relatively stable Uhlam lifestyle, with few external threats, leads many of these halflings to seek out simple comforts and pursuits that they find extremely fulfilling.",
				"They often adopt professions that require dedication and discipline, such as farming, sewing, or banking. They also eagerly take on tasks that require planning and hard work, such as shipbuilding or construction. Although Uhlams like the long process of creation, they are often very free with the fruits of their labors. They enjoy crafting comfortable homesteads for family and friends, making a decent living from well-tended crops, and seeing their family fortunes grow from patient investing. While an Othoban halfling might extol the complex flavors of a meal, an Uhlam would instead focus on the many steps to create it and savor seeing loved ones enjoy it.",
				"Heritages The following heritage is available to halflings.",
				"Observant Halfling Your finely honed senses quickly clue you in to danger or trickery. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your {@skill Perception} DC, though not to your {@skill Perception} checks.",
				"OTHOBAN ADVENTURERS Today, many Othobans have taken to adventuring to fulfill their desire to learn more and experience Golarion.",
				"Some Othoban halflings have chosen to remain in New Thassilon and its neighboring regions, taking a slower approach to exploring the world, while others have set their sights on experiencing the rest of Avistan and beyond, and a smaller group of Othobans has chosen to remain in the safety of Edasseril. As Othobans tend to be studious and observant, those that become adventurers are usually clerics, rogues, or wizards.",

Their bodies are vaguely humanoid in shape, with numerous characteristics of the plant or fungus from which they were made. A typical leshy is about 3 feet tall. Due to the nature of the ritual used to create a leshy, leshies begin their lives as adults. As spirits, they do not age, and a leshy could potentially remain in the same vessel forever\u2014though leshies rarely consider this outcome to be desirable.",

To most leshies, the concept of family is not a matter of birth, but rather determined by bonds of loyalty and friendship. Leshies are dedicated allies, but they have little tolerance for those who would despoil nature. As much as they are happy to accept someone who earns their trust into their family, they expect family members to look out for them and their natural wards in return. A betrayed leshy might not directly attack those who slight them, but they might withdraw support at a critical moment or leave their betrayers to get lost in the wilderness.",
				"Leshies are grouped into categories akin to ethnicities, but these are not connected to physical features; rather, they represent broad categories of characteristics of their spirits. Certain spirits are more likely to gravitate toward particular physical bodies, though those familiar with leshies know that this predisposition is far from absolute. Leshies often take pride in their LESHY ADVENTURERS Some backgrounds are particularly suitable for adventuring leshies, especially those backgrounds with a tie to the natural world, such as hunter, nomad, or scout.",

Leshies' genders are determined by the spirits that inhabit their bodies. Leshies tend to gravitate toward plant bodies that match their genders. Some leshies are exclusively male or female, while many consider themselves both. Others, particularly fungus leshies, tend toward far more complex expressions of gender, or eschew the concept entirely.",
				"Alignment and {@skill Religion} A leshy can be of any alignment, depending on what spirit inhabits their body, but their outlook often includes a neutral element. {@skill Religion} is not particularly significant to most leshies. Those with a philosophical bent lean toward the Green Faith, and Gozreh is the most popular deity among faithful leshies. Some leshies also venerate green men, powerful spirits of nature that act as regional guardians.",
				"Names Leshies choose and change their names multiple times throughout their lives. These names often represent a facet of their personalities or values, though another common naming convention is to use descriptions of a natural feature they admire. Some leshies even use a cycle of names that changes to align with natural phenomena, such as names based upon the season or the time of day.",

				"While there are no official titles among the Firebrands, every member is categorized in the context of four different rankings, known as marks, a system derived from the Firebrand symbol of two crossed swords. The first use of this symbol originated among Vidric rebels who rose up to reclaim their lands; the rebels used the swords featured on the Sargavan flag as a means of communication, drawing or painting the blades on structures to signify safe houses or {@condition hidden} caches. The simplicity of the symbol\u2014two large marks for the sword blades and two smaller marks for the cross guard\u2014made it easy for Vidrics to leave a message with short notice. Vidrics continued to use this mark until it became the official symbol of the Firebrands. Today, the symbol is used wherever the Firebrands wish to make their presence known, though individual marks vary. Firebrands place specific symbols beneath the crossed blades, such as a silver raven or a specific ship's flag, to further signify exactly who made the mark and which local group claims responsibility for a particular act.",
				"Anyone can declare themselves as a member of the Firebrands, though status as a member is not considered official until a potential recruit gains a significant amount of notoriety. This usually requires several dozen locals in an area, typically 50, or a handful of local Firebrands to become aware of the prospective member. The process is often relatively quick, as most wishing to join can make a public declaration, usually in a loud and showy manner.",
				"Once this is done, the prospective member earns the title of first mark. The ease of becoming a first mark means that first marks come and go constantly, and most Firebrands do not consider a first mark truly official until a member reaches the rank of second mark.",
				"To reach the status of second mark, a Firebrand of second mark or higher must make a declaration that the first mark is an official Firebrand. This declaration can be made in public, as with the initial claim of membership, or in private among other Firebrands. Regardless of the publicity, the declaration is capped with the Firebrand and the first mark crossing blades. In cases where no blades are available, the two cross any weapon at hand, or even cross arms when no weapons are available. This symbolic recreation of the Firebrand symbol allows the second mark access to the resources of the local Firebrands, such as armaments, contacts, equipment, safe houses, or training.",
				"Third marks are simply second marks who have gained local fame.",
				"Sometimes these are individuals known by name or an alias. Other times, an entire group can become a third mark due to the group's notoriety in its home region. In this case, anyone that is a member of said group is a third mark, regardless of their standing or seniority within the group itself. Firebrands don't designate the third mark ranking based on any internal parameters, instead recognizing the ranking when the common populace is aware of the members; once a Firebrand or group of Firebrands becomes well known, whether due to popularity or infamy, they are third marks regardless of what other Firebrands may think of it. Most Firebrands acknowledge that it's hard to determine exactly when this happens, but it becomes obvious once locals start expressing outward opinions of a Firebrand.",
				"The title of fourth mark is even more nebulous than that of third mark.",
				"Fourth marks are those Firebrands that almost everyone knows. These can be individuals whose names travel in stories across Golarion, like Devrin Arlos or the Sapphire Butterfly. Others are groups like the Silver Ravens that achieved great recognition due to their deeds and thus all members, new and old, are considered fourth marks. Much like the ranking of third mark, there's no official threshold for a fourth mark\u2014only a nebulous consensus once fellow Firebrands or distant locals begin to share stories about the deeds of a particular individual or a certain group. Many Firebrands like to debate about specific individuals or groups to determine whether or not they are worthy of becoming fourth marks. Even with the constant debates, Firebrands universally recognize certain key members as fourth marks, usually those in leadership roles.",
				"While it's easy for anyone to begin their journey as a member of the Firebrands, the nature of the organization helps to sniff out those who are attempting to infiltrate the group. First off, anyone who has heard of the Firebrands knows the group does not intentionally harm innocents. The Firebrands typically squabble with local authorities, oppressive groups, or, in some cases, with each other, and while collateral damage to innocents is always a possibility, anyone who sets out specifically to harm innocents in the name of the Firebrands is quickly dismissed. These people never become second marks and likely draw the ire of proper Firebrands. In addition, individual Firebrands constantly work to maintain their local networks.",
				"Often, this manifests as secret codes and signals among rebels that change at regular intervals. Individuals who might bring harm to the Firebrands do not receive these updates, and soon find themselves marked as obvious outcasts. For Firebrands without such systems in place, the local populace still acts as the Firebrands' eyes and ears. Allies of the Firebrands report any issues or concerns they have with other members, allowing the larger body of Firebrands to respond accordingly.",
				"Firebrands Across the Inner Sea Though the Firebrands are a relatively young organization, especially compared to other prominent organizations like the Pathfinder {@skill Society}, the group's popularity has grown quickly in the years since its formation. Once the first rumors of Firebrands supporting local rebellions started to spread, pockets of resistance throughout Avistan began to call out to the Firebrands. These groups placed the Firebrand's crossed-blade symbol wherever they could, and soon enough other rebels rallied to their cause. In some of these cases, such as with the ongoing resistance in Pezzack, Firebrands made the trek to offer their support. At other times, the locals inspired themselves with their actions and gathered enough local support that they became their own local group of Firebrands.",
				"This was the case with the small kingdom of Crossroads in the southern River Kingdoms, where the locals rose up against a local group of marauders that constantly threatened the fledgling kingdom's livelihood.",
				"Once the more boisterous side of the Firebrands came to the forefront, the group's notoriety increased quickly. Many found the Firebrands' behavior entertaining, while others were awestruck by the tales of great heroics or perilous acts from which a Firebrand escapes unscathed. Traveling Firebrands soon found themselves overwhelmed with bored homemakers and excited locals insisting on hearing tales of the latest Firebrand exploits. Sometimes these tales were recountings of thrilling exploits, while others are merely exhilarating lies. Regardless of their validity, such tales only boosted the exciting Firebrand way of life, soon making the Firebrands something of a household name.",
				"Today, Firebrands continue to uphold their traditions all over the Inner Sea region, with many finding their ways to large port cities like Absalom, Almas, and Magnimar. These cities provide numerous eyes for those seeking attention, and plenty of crowds for those looking to disappear.",
				"The cities also allow any would-be Firebrands to hop on to a ship and join up with a Firebrand crew with relative ease.",
				"Many of these crews set off upon the high seas in search of adventure and treasure in places like the Shackles or even beyond the Inner Sea. Some smaller towns also harbor a Firebrand presence, though how easy it is to identify such groups varies from one town to the next.",
				"Dressing the Part While members of the Firebrands are primarily known for their adventurous exploits and their work fighting oppression, they are also at the forefront of fashion. When the first grandstanders began gaining attention, they were quick to realize that it would require greater and greater exploits to attract notice while other Firebrands were engaging in their own astonishing ventures. To attract the gaze of onlookers and draw more attention to their own deeds, some Firebrands began sporting elaborate outfits with eye‑catching colors and ostentatious accessories.",
				"Firebrand fashion has begun to take hold in places like Absalom and Andoran, with many younger nobles and local adventurers taking to gaudy clothing, bright feathers, excessive amounts of jewelry, and large hats to emulate the styles of notable Firebrands. Since this flare in popular fashion, Firebrands and fashionistas all over have tweaked and reworked this original fashion trend to suit their own tastes.",
				"Current Firebrand fashion varies greatly from region to region, but those seeking attention make the most of what's available to them. Some Firebrands take local fashions and alter them to be outrageously showy and glamorous.",
				"Other Firebrands create entire outfits from scratch, allowing them to express their creative sides. Some of these outfits are marvels all their own, mimicking great birds or incorporating wearable contraptions that can independently wave flags or even play music.",
				"Local Firebrand groups tend to adopt their own particular fashion trends and colors, with certain groups coordinating clothing across their membership. Such Firebrands sometimes even modify their symbols with specific colors, which helps to differentiate such groups in places where multiple Firebrand-affiliated organizations are active.",
				"Firebrands who prefer subtlety instead choose simpler clothing that allows them to slip in and out of crowds {@condition unnoticed}. In situations where anonymity is important, these Firebrands wear masks or other disguises that make identification difficult.",
				"Firebrand Options The Firebrands use a variety of unorthodox equipment and techniques to achieve their goals, whether those goals include drawing attention, or subterfuge and subtlety. The following Firebrand options are uncommon, and members of the Firebrands gain access to them once they reach the rank of second mark. The Entourage feat is rare even for members of the Firebrands, as it requires a certain degree of fame and in-world activity to acquire, and potentially requires the player or GM to keep track of additional background NPCs. Typically, only third mark and fourth mark Firebrands have the notoriety and social influence required to maintain an entourage.",
				"While Firebrands seek to build an entourage more than most adventurers, it's not unreasonable for any famous character to gain access to it if the players are interested in playing with the Entourage feat.",
				"Firebrands Feats The following feats allow Firebrands to easily hide among a populace or gather crowds around them."

				"Magaambyan Masks Once a Magaambyan student reaches the rank of attendant, they are granted the right to wear a personal mask that is acknowledged by the teachers and other students at the academy. This mask is an abstract representation of the outward magic that the attendant chooses to focus on, the internal magic that is an intrinsic part of the attendant, and the attendant's true spiritual face, symbolizing the blending of all four essences of magic. These masks almost always take the form of animals, as the true form of these concepts is both impossible to depict in the material world and too personal to share with others.",
				"The mask begins as a mere construction of wood and paint, carved into the shape of an animal the attendant feels a powerful connection to; while some students choose more prestigious animals over those of personal importance, this often results in the mask's magic becoming unruly and acting out in undesirable ways.",
				"The mask serves as a focus for the attendant's magic by bridging the physical and spiritual realms, causing the mask to gain a life and mind of its own. As the attendant continues to grow, their spirit leaves more and more of an imprint on the mask, until the mask houses the attendant's true magical self. Once this occurs, the bond between mask and attendant cannot be severed unless the mask is destroyed, freeing the attendant's spiritual face to be released back into the attendant's body. A side effect of this process is that the Magaambyan's spiritual self, usually limited to appearing only in otherworldly dreams or visions, is granted far more power over the world\u2014and over the Magaambyan themselves. Although the attendant can control the mask, the mask can also exert its influence over the attendant or even manifest as a familiar (see the Mask Familiar feat on page 101)",
				"This can sometimes seem jarring to those who witness it for the first time, as the odd personality contained within can seem like a completely different person than the attendant, but to the Magaambyans, the mask is simply another facet of the student.",
				"Not every Magaambyan chooses to wear a mask; some prefer to contact their spiritual selves the old-fashioned way, while others feel uncomfortable allowing something so personal to be seen by others, even in an abstract form. Others, such as the Magaambya's magic warriors, subsume their whole identity into the mask, disguising every other aspect of themselves.",
				"Magaambyan Options Magaambyans learn techniques to harness the power of the following options.",
				"Halcyon Spells Through hard study, Magaambyans can meld arcane and primal spellcasting.",
				"Halcyon spells are spells from the arcane or primal spell list. You don't gain new halcyon spells via the normal means you typically use to gain spells; instead, you gain new halcyon spells and new spell levels of halcyon spells only through feats. Halcyon spells are prepared or cast just like other spells granted by your class; for example, a wizard who gained halcyon spells would add them to their spell list and their spellbook, while a sorcerer would add them to their spell list and their spell repertoire. If you have more than one arcane or primal spellcasting class, you add halcyon spells to all such classes.",
				"Each time you cast a halcyon spell, decide whether it is an arcane or primal spell. You can't heighten a halcyon spell beyond your maximum spell level of halcyon spell, even if you have higher-level spell slots, and you can't select a halcyon spell as a signature spell.",
				"Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, and each time you gain a halcyon feat, you can swap out one of your old halcyon spells for a different halcyon spell of the same level; this is in addition to any swapping from your class, such as via a sorcerer's spell repertoire class feature. You can also swap out halcyon spells by retraining during downtime. If you have a spellbook, when you swap out a halcyon spell, you lose the spell from your spellbook entirely.",
				"Magaambyan Magic Item The following magic item is uncommon, but characters who are Magaambyans of at least attendant rank have access to it (see the sidebar on page 65). PCs who start a game as members of the Magaambya typically begin at attendant rank.",

				"The Magaambya created the first scrollstaves millennia ago, and even the few scrollstaves found beyond the organization often incorporate Magaambyan iconography as an homage to their source.",
				"A scrollstaff serves as a weapon just like an ordinary staff and can be improved via runes like any other staff. In addition, if you are capable of creating magical scrolls, you can inscribe a single scroll onto the staff's head for the same cost as normal for {@skill Crafting} the scroll. If necessary, you can embed a required material focus into the staff as part of the same {@action Craft} activity.",
				"As long as you are holding the staff, you can cast the spell from the staff's head.",
				"Casting the written spell works just like casting from a scroll, but you can perform the necessary material component with the staff, even if you don't have a free hand.",
				"Once you cast the inscribed spell, any material focus remains embedded in the staff until removed as an {@action Interact} action.",
				"The staff can hold only a single scroll at a time. If you inscribe a new scroll before casting the previous spell, you replace the existing spell and remove any previous material focus as part of the {@action Craft} activity to write the new scroll."

Halcyon speakers are powerful conversants who epitomize the Magaambyan practice of blending arcane and primal magic, seeing both traditions as flowing from the same wellspring."

You cast the spell at the same spell level as the spell you absorbed, but the spell is of your magical tradition and uses your spell DC, spell attack roll, and other statistics to determine its effects.",
