Artokus would remain a hermit, secreted in a {@condition hidden} and heavily defended citadel in the Barrier Wall. Each year, he would send forth a blind, mute servant bearing six vials of the elixir. These would then be auctioned off\u2014never to fellow Thuvians, lest they incur Pharasma's wrath\u2014in a one-bid auction, with all proceeds (including the losing bids) going to the government.

Each of the five major cities is built to accommodate a huge influx of visitors twice a decade as merchants and entertainers flood in to accommodate the foreign bidders and their retinues. It has also forced the cities to strengthen their defenses, whether with magical or military might, lest outside nations seek to annex them or take the elixir by force. Foreign gold has built vast palaces and irrigation projects, universities and theaters. Yet even with all of this, most Thuvians are never directly involved in the elixir trade, instead herding flocks in the traditional nomadic style, mining ore and salt, trading with merchant caravans, or wrestling the desert into fertile bloom.",

Merab is often seen as the capital due to it being twice the size of the next largest city, though it has no more power than its fellows. Famed for its alchemy, the city's Flowing Market bursts with potions ranging from the mundane to the impossible. Alchemical street lamps light the night, as do the eternal flames atop the minarets of the Temple of the Redeeming Sun, the largest Sarenite temple in the country.

In one such escalation, Geb and his grim devotees conducted rituals that corrupted the rural lands of Nex, denuding its forests in an instant and forever blighting its plains.

Nex carved off a shard of the Crux to create the mile-tall Spire of Nex outside of Absalom, as well as the so-called Refuge of Nex, a supernatural haven he constructed in the basement dungeons of his personal palace, the Bandeshar.
