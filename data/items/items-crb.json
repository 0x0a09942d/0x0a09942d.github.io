You can then use the\nstone’s quicksilver for one of two effects:\n• You can apply the stone’s quicksilver to an\ninfused true elixir of life using an Interact\naction. This turns the elixir into an infused elixir\nof rejuvenation instantaneously. This doesn’t\nrequire any crafting time or additional materials.\n• You can spend up to a month of downtime applying\nthe quicksilver either to iron to create silver or to lead\nto create gold.

UPGRADING ARMOR AND WEAPON RUNES You’ll often want to upgrade the fundamental runes of magic armor or a magic weapon you already have. This requires upgrading each rune separately. Tables 11–5 and 11–6 summarize the Price of each step, with a number in parentheses indicating the item’s level for the Craft activity. This also indicates the typical progression for an adventurer to follow when upgrading their armor and weapons. The tables here don’t include progressions that aren’t as likely to come up, like turning a +1 weapon directly into a +1 greater striking weapon.

If a suit of armor or a weapon has multiple etchings of the same rune, only the highest-level one applies. You can upgrade a property rune to a higher-level type of that rune in the same way you would upgrade a fundamental rune.

Arrow slits along the lower battlements and crenelations at the top provide standard cover to anyone within the fortress. There’s no roof, leaving an open, 10-foot-square vertical shaft through the center of the structure. As a magical structure, the fortress has the structure trait. Because it expands outward, the fortress can’t catch creatures inside it as a magical structure normally does. Instead, it pushes those creatures back. It can’t push a creature into a surface or hazard this way, and stops expanding if that would happen. The fortress has a single door in the center of one wall on the ground level, and the door appears directly in front of you when you activate the fortress. Provided you’re within 100 feet of the door, you can cause the door to open or slam shut and lock by spending a single action to issue a verbal command, which has the auditory trait. The DC to Force Open the door or Pick its Lock is 40. You can instantly return the instant fortress to its cube form by spending a single action to issue a verbal command, which has the auditory trait. Once deactivated, the fortress can’t be activated again for 4 hours. If the fortress becomes damaged, it can be repaired only with a remake spell or by someone who is legendary at Crafting."
