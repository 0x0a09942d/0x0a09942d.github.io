This longevity grants them a perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.",

They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the  founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.",
