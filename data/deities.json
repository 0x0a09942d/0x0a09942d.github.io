								"Asmodeus is the First, the Dark Prince, the lord of darkness and law, and the ruler of the plane of Hell. If Asmodeus's own scriptures are to believed\u2014and they are corroborated by certain other accounts, like the angel-penned Book of the Damned\u2014he is one of the oldest beings of the multiverse. These texts claim that in time before time, in a world not yet created, Asmodeus and his brother Ihys were among the first gods in existence. During these unnamed ages, the two gods quarreled over the fate of the souls of their creations, and Asmodeus slew his brother. Confident that Ihys's act of granting mortals free will was folly, Asmodeus made his own convictions known: that existence is best served by absolute order and discipline. These claims contradict other popular creation myths, and both theologians and immortal agents of the gods doubt Asmodeus's claims to varying degrees, but while there is no evidence to prove them, they are also difficult to refute.",
								"Asmodeus can take any form he wishes. His best-known depiction, however, is the appearance he is given in popular art: an ancient being with striking red skin and black horns and hooves, surrounded with a pale aura of flames. He is shown either bearing a long contract scroll and a vicious -looking flaming mace, or seated upon a throne ruling over hordes of devils above the apocalyptic landscape of Hell. Asmodeus is known to be eloquent, tactful, patient, and incredibly brilliant, but when angered, he is wrathful and terrifying.",
								"Despite his fiendish depiction and the widespread knowledge of his disdain for free will, many mortals worship Asmodeus. Setting aside the question of good and evil (he most certainly is evil), Asmodeus is an immensely powerful divine being\u2014perhaps one of the most powerful in existence. He represents strict discipline, as he was a being of order long before the concepts of right and wrong were created. This representation of Asmodeus as a champion of law means that his worship is not limited to cults and hushed whispers.",
								"Even though it is heavily frowned upon in most areas of the world, his worship is nevertheless widespread and occasionally, in cases like the nation of Cheliax, the primary religion of a region.",
								"Servitors of Asmodeus include power-hungry priests, diabolists, lawyers, and the decadent nobility of Hell-bound regions like Cheliax. These followers find the inherent structure of Hell a virtue and even seek to emulate it through clever use of the law. Making use of such order allows followers to vie for higher positions of power, usually by taking advantage of complicated bureaucracies. This is a skill that most Asmodeans share, as the church's holy text, the Asmodean Monograph, is itself a tome with several supplemental volumes and appendices that together require a deep understanding to even navigate, much less exploit. Asmodeans are careful in their pursuit of power, however, as a quick ascension or an overextension can leave one vulnerable to those intent on finding weakness.",
								"Beyond his clerics and priests, Asmodeus has hold over several other types of worshippers. Soldiers and other martially minded individuals might welcome Asmodeus's gifts and the dogma of force and dominance required to wield them, but regardless of their role, anyone seeking great power or wealth likely finds themself facing the Dark Prince's temptations. These might take the form of a local Asmodean priest offering such gifts through questionable yet technically legal means. Other times, devils appear to offer literal infernal contracts accepting the signer's soul in exchange for greater abilities, such as spellcasting or the ability to summon that devil.",
								"Temples of Asmodeus vary greatly from region to region, depending on the faith's reception. Public temples to the Dark Prince typically feature gothic or baroque architecture. In Cheliax, his temples sometimes double as government buildings or share space with such structures. Inside, bureaucrats, judges, and other government workers use their understanding of contracts and laws to maintain the infernal machine of order. In places less open to worship of Asmodeus, his temples may be secret sites, such as hidden shrines in personal homes or concealed temples accessible only via secret doors and halls."

Abadaran priests living in cities often serve as judges, lawyers, and clerks, while those who live on the frontier work as roving magistrates, acting as judge, jury, and executioners in the name of order.",

The Vault is home to the perfect longsword, the perfect shield, the perfect songbird, the perfect hammer, and even a perfect law. His followers do their best to emulate these perfect forms in their own way, whether through crafting a work of art, raising strong and healthy livestock, or passing laws that best serve the people in a community.",
								"The holy book of Abadar's worshippers, {@i The Order of Numbers}, commands his followers to build cities and settlements where there are none, to work hard and trade in pursuit of wealth, and to follow the law while doing so. If a profession is a lawful part of society, it is ordained by Abadar. As such, those who work at the behest of government often pay homage to Abadar, as do others who directly benefit from the rule of law and trade. Naturally, those who oppose the law or actively work against it\u2014such as thieves, criminals, bandits, and pirates\u2014are enemies of the church and society as Abadar sees it. Despite this, some heretical factions of Abadar's worshippers twist the words of {@i The Order of Numbers} for their own purposes to pursue wealth over all. They justify their criminal behavior with the holy words of order and wealth while subverting the rule of law on technicalities, undermining law-abiding institutions.",
								"As the god of cities and laws, Abadar is a stern but just master. He rewards those who work hard and looks down on those who would cheat the system for their own gains. Abadar understands that not everyone gets a fair deal in the world of mortals, but he encourages his clergy to support laws that are as equitable as possible, enabling those of lower status to rise. The church frowns on slavery, believing that trade should always be fair and that no price offered can ever compensate the entirety of a creature's life and labor.",
								"Clerics of Abadar labor to help their communities grow and flourish. They seek to aid in the passage of effective laws and encourage bringing order to places where it is absent. When ministering to their congregants, clerics wear robes of white silk with accents of gold that show the wealth of their church. Temples dedicated to Abadar are fortified, as they often serve double duty as banks, moneylenders, and currency exchanges. Despite this practical purpose, these temples tend to be highly decorated, commonly featuring elegant architecture adorned with gold and stained-glass windows.",
								"The church of Abadar in Avistan feels it must charge for its divine services in tribute to the god of merchants, but his servants seek to handle matters of public health and safety quickly, and without requiring payment. Priests are also encouraged to strike out on business ventures as a holy duty to enrich the church. These holy ventures often put members of an individual church and those of neighboring churches in competition. Such competition is seen as healthy and often encouraged; however, church law forbids clergy from harming one another, including during warfare on behalf of opposed nations or kingdoms. As a result, Abadarans often act as a neutral negotiators between warring nations\u2014for a fee, of course.",
								"Through {@i The Order of Numbers}, Abadar teaches his clergy that following the law leads to wealth and comfort, and thus happiness. He teaches that discipline leads to keen judgment, which in turn leads to favorable deals, whether they relate to commerce, law, or other types of negotiations. While Abadar encourages the expansion of ordered society, he rejects hasty action and advises caution in all things. Abadaran clergy pass these tenets on to their congregations, teaching the layfolk about trade and commerce as a system for happiness. These teachings also impart the ideals of fairness and following the spirit of the law, while still respecting the letter thereof. One of the church's most important lessons is the value of cooperation between citizens, as community is paramount to the health of a town and kingdom. However, they also recognize that self-interest is most individuals' strongest motivation to increase their own standing and wealth."

This conclusion is not entirely unreasonable, as Calistria represents those aspects of the elven ancestry that many other people see as alluring, intriguing, and fascinating. Among elves, she embodies characteristics endemic to elven culture and identity, such as free-spirited pursuit of one's own path, and further embodies a truth lost on shorter-lived peoples: the flexibility and capriciousness of Calistria provides a model for maintaining perspective and composure over a centuries-long lifespan. As a result, she is closely associated with the elven people by elves and others alike. Of the elven deities, she receives by far the most worship from non-elves.",
								"As the goddess's whims are ever-shifting, her worshippers are also often somewhat transient. Even among elves, worship of Calistria is usually intermittent or secondary to faith in another deity. Prayers to Calistria arise from individuals who find themselves driven by lust, engaged in trickery, or driven to revenge, and the people offering those prayers may have no commitment to the faith beyond the prayer offered in that moment. As followers' lives lead them in different directions, they move on to other deities, just as the goddess herself moves from one lover to the next to suit her shifting interests. This personal freedom is a value held dear by the goddess and her followers alike, and perhaps one of the most central values to elven society as a whole. Some of Calistria's most devoted followers work to promote this tenet, quietly working to undermine tyrannical governments, exacting revenge upon slavers and freeing their captives, or simply demonstrating the benefits of a freedom-driven lifestyle.",
								"As the god of cities and laws, Abadar is a stern but just master. He rewards those who work hard and looks down on those who would cheat the system for their own gains. Abadar understands that not everyone gets a fair deal in the world of mortals, but he encourages his clergy to support laws that are as equitable as possible, enabling those of lower status to rise. The church frowns on slavery, believing that trade should always be fair and that no price offered can ever compensate the entirety of a creature's life and labor.",
								"Organized worship of Calistria is most common among elves, as befits an elven deity. Though rumor would suggest all her temples are brothels, these gathering spaces are often more akin to intellectual salons\u2014albeit more encouraging and supportive of sexual interaction between attendees than most equivalent secular institutions. Others function more akin to a thieves' guild, providing a place to sow and reap rumors, plot acts of questionable legality, and perhaps also engage in lust-driven interactions\u2014all activities suitable to take place behind closed doors.",
								"Clerics of the goddess endeavor to hold the three aspects of their goddess in balance, as a lifetime in service to any one can easily become monotonous, and Calistria abhors her followers becoming overly consumed by a single pursuit. Champions are sometimes more focused, such as those who dedicate themselves to fighting slavery, but even these are careful to avoid becoming so wrapped up in their work that they lose sight of the other aspects of life that make it worth living.",
								"Special rituals, conducted as needed, include invocations of the goddess's blessing when a worshipper begins pursuit of a desired lover, divinations to determine her approval or disapproval of set courses of revenge, initiation rites for those who wish to devote themselves to the faith, and birth and death ceremonies. But Calistria's faith places little stock in marriage; between the goddess's own shifting interests and the mercurial nature of relationships between long-lived elves, marriage is much less of an institution as it is among other peoples.",
								"Wasps are iconic to Calistria, as widely recognized as a symbol of the faith as her formal religious symbol. Like the goddess, a wasp inflicts extreme pain in retribution for an offense, far beyond what it seems a simple insect ought to be capable of. Further cementing the similarity is the fact that the wasp seems to take a perverse pleasure in its attacks, pursuing offenders and stinging repeatedly. Many followers of Calistria carry yellow-and-black tokens on their person as a form of homage. Priests are known to cultivate giant wasp allies and pets, and many Calistrian gathering places harbor swarms of wasps under the eaves or in similarly sheltered spots. These swarms tend to ignore worshippers but descend in force upon any interlopers, defending such locations with even greater spite than expected from a typical wasp."

								"Once a mortal human, Cayden Cailean is now one the few deities known as the Ascended. In his mortal years, Cayden was a sellsword of no small fame, known for his boisterous manner, skill with a blade, and fearless resolve. During a particularly rowdy night of drinking, a series of escalating dares led the wandering mercenary to attempt the Test of the Starstone. He emerged from the Starstone Cathedral 3 days later, laughing, a fully realized god. Divine responsibility did little to change Cayden's attitude from what it was in his mortal life. He continues to crave adventure, drink, and pleasurable company while abhorring bullies, tyrants, and cowards.",
								"Cayden has no formal churches or structured clergy, but simple shrines to him appear in almost every tavern and roadside inn. Many of his priests own such businesses and offer healing to patrons, some of whom may have been injured during a drunken brawl. While Cayden's faith is a charitable one, Caydenites still seek payment for such services\u2014at the very least, the injured party is expected to purchase a round of drinks for the house. Only in places where worshippers of the Accidental God are in direct opposition to the local powers, such as where a rebellion is forming under a tyrant's nose, is his church out of the public eye. Caydenites can bring themselves to be quiet in the face of oppression only for so long, however, and once a rebellion reaches full bloom, the god's silver tankard is often proudly displayed across every bar.",
								"As a mortal, Cayden often found himself at odds with the work he was hired to perform and abandoned jobs that went against his conscience. This gave him a reputation for being unreliable among his more unscrupulous employers, but it garnered significant respect from clients with stronger morals. Legends tell of him taking contracts to free entire crews of slaves, undoing the operations of predatory business owners, and other rebellious deeds for the good of the common folk. His worshippers often involve themselves in similar matters: safeguarding the freedom and prosperity of working-class people, overthrowing tyrants, and helping the oppressed relocate to freer lands. His champions, in particular, embed themselves in nations with harsh laws and stir up rebellions\u2014often from the back room of a tavern.",
								"Members of Cayden's faith also maintain many orphanages in urban areas, arranging them to receive funding from local pubs and other Cayden-friendly establishments. Not much is known about Cayden's childhood as a mortal, but given his patronage of such houses, many have inferred that he spent at least some time in an orphanage when he was young. While the children in such orphanages are not expressly raised in the faith, most adopt the god's teachings when they grow old enough to leave. These individuals often take the surname Cailean to honor him, adding to the number of gregarious rebels in the world.",
								"While the consumption of alcohol is central to most of Cayden's worship, drinking to excess and dependency on drink are seen as misuse of the Accidental God's gifts. Clergy who develop such an addiction are encouraged by their community to take a large role in the faith's other works, such as maintaining orphanages or supporting rebel efforts, and those who recover often work to assist others with their own recovery from alcoholism. Though being the god of alcohol is a popular aspect of Cayden Cailean, members of his faith often find personal freedom and rejection of tyranny just as appealing as a strong drink, and it is not uncommon for teetotalers to number among Cayden's followers.",
								"Cayden is not particular about who worships him, so long as they abide by the simple expectations of freedom, bravery, and enjoying a good drink. As such, he has followers from almost all ancestries. A good number of his worshippers are half-orcs, who find the casual tenets and welcoming nature of the faith to be a good fit for those who have been ostracized from more stringent communities. His followers are typically good natured, boisterous, and optimistic. Life simply holds too much to take in for anyone to spend it gloomy. Many adventurers find Cayden's tenets to be a natural fit, taking jobs when they can and bucking cruelty wherever they find it."

								"The night didn't know beauty until Desna came into existence. While the other gods toiled away to create the world, she set her sights on the heavens, placing each star in the sky. After surveying her artistry, she hung the brightest star high in the north and made it her home. Her first gift to mortals was this beacon of hope, a twinkling sign in the dark sky that they could turn to when lost or unsure of themselves. Desna provides safe passage through the darkness to all, should they choose to follow.",
								"Desna journeys without end, for the wonders of the universe are endless. She relies on instinct to guide her, paying no mind to planning or destination. Her lapsing attention may come off as uncaring or cold, but Desna simply prefers an untethered, carefree existence. Her confidence in herself and her followers frees her from the indulgence of worry. She knows fate can always be rewritten and encourages others to embrace all that life has to offer. Desna wants her followers to take chances, get messy, and live life to its fullest. Those who follow her teachings she rewards with a spot of luck\u2014revealing unseen shortcuts, dangers to be circumvented, and undiscovered wonders.",
								"Desna is an ancient being, born during the dawn of time, but her sense of wonder has never faded. Even so, she is no stranger to hardship, understanding that fate can be cruel and love can be lost. This only strengthens her resolve. She believes in good luck, and that people can make their own fortune in life. To Desna, no one is ever truly lost; they need only find their way back to the path. She revels in mystery, being herself somewhat of an enigma, but she can always be found on the side of hope. Light always pierces the darkness, and all nightmares eventually give way to dreams.",
								"The goddess loves music and live performances. Legends say Desna played the world's first song by ringing the stars to celebrate the gods' completion of the material world. Her faithful have embraced her love of music and the arts and are often performers themselves, with many modern songs and dances having their roots in Desnan worship. Artists devoted to Desna have created some of the most famous poems and ballads on Gods of the Inner Sea and often perform in conjunction with Shelynites. A sizable portion of Desna's priesthood are bards, spreading her songs across the world on their travels.",
								"Desna encourages her followers to chase their bliss, find what impassions them, and explore. She recognizes love in all its forms and remains committed to her lovers Sarenrae and Shelyn. She also shares a close relationship with Cayden Cailean and has no reservations about taking on new lovers. Desna is protective of those she cares for and does not hesitate to strike back at any who would hurt or impede those she has placed under her protection.",
								"When making a rare appearance to mortals, Desna appears as a beautiful woman with long dark hair and shining stars in her eyes. Brilliant, colorful patterns of pinks, purples, and blues trail behind her like a comet's tail as her majestic butterfly wings fly her through the cosmos. If she wishes to make her desires known, she imparts wondrous dreams to her followers, allowing them the rare opportunity to dance among the stars with her.",
								"There is little sense of authority within the Desnan church, though on Gods of the Inner Sea it is a faith that dates as far back as ancient Azlant. The church lacks any sort of hierarchy, and priests are valued by the tales of the journeys they've undertaken and the experiences they've had rather than for any seniority. A typical Desnan service is performed almost entirely in song, with interludes of dance, storytelling, and dream recollection interspersed throughout.",
								"Most centers of worship for Desna are not ornate temples but instead small, unattended shrines. These shrines are most commonly found at crossroads, remote areas of beauty, or the tops of hills where the stars can be viewed unimpeded. Traveling Desnan priests clean and maintain these shrines as they encounter them, leaving their signatures behind as a way of marking their own journey."

								"Unlike many other good deities, Erastil does not send his followers out into the world to fight and crush evil. Eschewing crusades and other ventures that take his followers away from their homes, Erastil watches over those who devote their lives to family and community. He is primarily an agricultural deity, specifically focusing on those aspects of nature that either can be tamed or are of use to his followers. His domain encompasses the plants and animals that farmers, hunters, and ranchers deal with in their everyday lives. While he is a protective deity, Erastil steps in only when quiet, pastoral lives are threatened. He desires his followers to live their lives in peace, with no risk of being conscripted into armies, devoured by monsters, or destroyed by magic.",
								"Family is of vital importance to the Elk Father. He places a high value on marriage and children, considering caring for a spouse and family to be one of the most important tasks in life. Erastil's communities advocate for the unmarried to wed as soon as possible, though they never force a marriage for the sake of tying the knot. Widows and widowers often remarry, especially if they are caring for children. Erastil frowns upon adultery and anything else that bends or breaks the bonds of marriage, such as a union built on lies. However, he understands when a marriage has been sullied by the likes of abuse and supports separation when it encourages the safety of an individual and community.",
								"Erastil sees building families as a goal for all people. Those who cannot bear children should still be ready to take in those who need a family, and his followers encourage those who remain single to act as surrogate parents and role models for children. He values traditions that build families, even when they are viewed as quaint by others, but he is willing to accept new traditions as long as they strengthen families rather than weakening them. The Elk Father is known to be slow to adapt to change, often trying to fit foreign ideas into a familiar framework, but he always supports strong relationships rather than rejecting them\u2014he thus accepts all manner of matrimony and family, so long as they are supportive of their respective communities.",
								"Erastil is thought by most to have his own family, but he rarely speaks of them to his followers or involves them directly in his faith. The Elk Father wishes to avoid worshippers becoming distracted by their god's relationships\u2014mortals should view their own families, whatever their makeup, as sacred, rather than focus on the family of a god simply because it is divine.",
								"When granting gifts, Erastil prefers practical boons over flashier miracles. Many believe he is the deity who originally gifted mortals the bow so they could hunt for sustenance\u2014but not for pleasure. He teaches farmers how to know when to sow and reap; ranchers how to tell when livestock are sick, lame, or gravid; and both how to heal humans and animals. His values are those of a slow-paced, pastoral life, one in which his followers respect and are sustained by the gifts of nature. He also teaches cooperation, and his priests are often the first to arrive at a barn-raising or house-building. Their sermons are as likely to be lessons in how to spot corn blight as anything philosophical.",
								"The vast majority of Erastilian priests are clerics, with a few druids and the occasional ranger. Champions of Erastil exist but are far less common than those of Torag or Iomedae. Although priests of Erastil act as leaders of the faith as the community requires, they live among the communities they serve and might be established artisans, farmers, or hunters in their own right. They support the community, often by providing healing services to livestock as well as people, blessing crops, and assisting with trade. Priests of Erastil are expected to marry, though it is not a requirement; many priests see their entire community as their family and a sacred commitment.",
								"Erastilian worship services are short and to the point, with sacred music designed to be sung and played while working. His temples, like his priests, serve multiple duties. In addition to being used for worship, these simple buildings serve as a general gathering place and a space to engage in crafts that require a lot of space and a roof. Erastil's major festival, Archerday, is celebrated with archery competitions, feasting, and often proposals of marriage.",
								"Erastil generally appears as a tall humanoid man with the head of an elk, clad in traditional hunter trappings and holding a bow, though he sometimes instead appears as a trapper of the particular follower's ancestry. This is especially common when he makes himself known to children or lost travelers, to help them remain at ease. All hooved animals are associated with Erastil, and elk are particularly sacred to his faith\u2014though he still allows hunting of these creatures, so long they are hunted out of necessity and with respect.",
								"Adventurers rarely worship Erastil, as he tends to attract those who prefer to stay home and concern themselves with their community and family. Those who do serve him tend to adventure for the good of their community; they may attempt to determine the cause of monster attacks on their settlement, earn money for something the villagers need and can't build themselves, or gain knowledge that is of use to their people."

								"The clash of steel, the cry of victory, the gasping denial of death: these are the sound of prayers to Our Lord in Iron, for to follow Gorum is to fight. Gorum does not care the reason for battle\u2014a village's desperate stand against raiders is no less worthwhile to him than a crusader army marching against demons in the Sarkoris Scar\u2014nor does he choose sides in such clashes. Good or evil, law or chaos, the reason for the fight is irrelevant. It is the thrill of battle that finds his favor, the crucible of struggle in which victory is there for the taking.",
								"Gorum recognizes the value of strategic warfare and the need for archery, siege weapons, and stealth, but those hold little allure for him compared to hand-to-hand combat, the contest of raw, brute strength against honed, deadly skill. Gorum takes no pleasure in one-sided fights or the slaughter of innocents; an armored knight drawing a sword in his name against a helpless peasant might find his blade rust away. Far more delightful would be the peasant's seemingly pointless swing of an iron pot, which might be answered as if it were a spoken prayer and transformed into a deadly blow.",
								"The god's followers hold that one is either brave or a coward, with battle the threshing floor that separates the wheat from the chaff. Death in battle is an honor. While tactical retreats or even breaks in fighting to negotiate are tolerable, no greater shame can befall a person than to flee from combat. Murder and assassination similarly offer no honor, and Gorum feels nothing but contempt for those practices, as well as for Achaekek and Norgorber, who condone them. The god and his followers likewise look on Urgathoa with disdain, as her diseases steal lives in the sickbed while the gluttony she promotes destroys warriors' fitness for meaningful battle.",
								"Gorum's followers are innumerable: soldiers, mercenaries, knights, and raiders across the Inner Sea region offer him tribute, especially in places where battle is an everyday way of life, such as Belkzen, the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, and the Gravelands. Believers claim that the god's spirit lives in iron and gird themselves in metal armor whenever possible. They fight frequently, though not always, to the death\u2014battle can establish dominance, relieve tension, or even just serve as prayer.",
								"His priests are hard to differentiate from his other followers. They commonly wear armor (or heavy robes that incorporate metal) as their vestments and are adorned with all manner of weapons, making them walking arsenals ready to draw steel at the slightest opportunity. Though Gorum has no sacred text, his followers learn the church's creed from a collection of seven heroic poems called the Gorumskagat. Each verse keeps to a rhythm that remains the same across all translations, which warriors learn to recognize and chant while on the march. These chants harmonize into the haunting sound of a roaring battle, and Gorumite warbands take great pride in chants that suggest great conflicts. Battle is the true language of Gorum, acting as the great unifier, and it differs little whether fought by those speaking Shoanti or Dwarven.",
								"Gorum's clerics preach that should all battle ever end, Gorum would abandon Gods of the Inner Sea, only to return when mortals inevitably clash again. His most holy sites are battlefields, consecrated by the struggles, blood, and lives of those fighting on them. His temples resemble fortresses, complete with armories and forges\u2014even those in the midst of peaceful cities. They contain images of the god, often pictured as a suit of spiked plate armor with burning red eyes. Shrines to him are simple: a pile of stones capped with a metal helm or a blade jammed into a crevice.",
								"Among adventurers, most Gorumites are humans or half-orcs, though followers can be found among all ancestries. They are valued companions thanks to their skill at defeating foes, even though violence tends to be their first answer to every problem. They typically set out not in search of great treasures but rather to find challenges, test their mettle, and honor their god in glorious combat. The most fortunate prove themselves by emerging from battle victorious time and time again, but even these are more likely to be slain on the battlefield than to retire and fade away into old age."

								"A timeless entity birthed from the first wind to stir the vast oceans, Gozreh wanders the world in the air and the seas. Sailors drop boxes of cargo as offerings to avoid a fatal storm, hoping to please the Wind and the Waves, even though they know that such pleas are far more likely to go unnoticed as they are to draw their deity's attention. The deity's temperament is fickle and their fury swift, hurling bolts of lightning and dragging to the crushing depths those who dare befoul the natural world. Gozreh is the sea that encapsulates the land and the wind that moves its surface, the birds that traverse the sky and the clouds that shield them.",
								"Gozreh is a deity of two aspects, depicted in art as one, the other, or both, depending on where the piece is featured. When coming from the ocean, she is shown as a woman with hair made of sea-foam rising waist-high from the waves. Over land and from the sky, he is drawn as an old man with a long beard, flecked black and gray by storm clouds with eyes of lightning. When depicted together, such as along shorelines, the two are portrayed reaching towards each other, their fingers separated by the smallest of margins. Yet these aspects are not separate: they represent the Wind and the Waves, but the deity is both of them and also neither, for they transcend the mortal concepts of gender and body.",
								"Much like the winds and seas, Gozreh is temperamental and prone to sudden outbursts of wrath. They see all, flitting from the north breeze to the eyes of a starling to the roots of a mighty oak on the other side of the world. Those who pollute nature or destroy the unspoiled wilds might feel a sudden storm of Gozreh's wrath descending upon them, but such fits are unpredictable and indiscriminate, sometimes striking years later and upturning the lives of nearby innocents with no tie to the original trespass. While Gozreh is volatile, they are not malicious. Their rage ceases as quickly as it begins, leaving the sky and waters calm again. The Wind and the Waves sees and feels everything at once, and they do not have the luxury of remaining focused on a single act of desecration for long.",
								"Gozreh is a worldly deity, their interest focused on the weather and living things. Land has little meaning to them, save that the soil gives foundation to trees and fire clears the way for new life. Such things are not reviled by Gozreh's faith; they are simply considered unimportant on their own. Creatures likewise exist and then they fade, ceding their energy to what comes after. The Wind and the Waves cares more for the wilds, unspoiled by mortals and free to ebb and flow as it sees fit.",
								"Gozreh's clergy and followers represent a wide variety of gender identities. The deity's dual nature resonates with these worshippers, and the faith accepts all identities as part of the natural order. The church doesn't place an emphasis on marriage in particular, and seasonal trysts are equally as common among worshippers as unions that last for life. Members of some of the more secluded sects of the faith remain celibate and isolated, residing in the most remote mountains or shoreline caves and reflecting on Gozreh's independence from relationships\u2014after all, as a deity of dual natures, Gozreh is never truly alone.",
								"Most of Gozreh's followers wear their hair long\u2014sometimes all the way to the ground\u2014and weave seaweed, coral, or shells into it in intricate patterns. Clergy who can do so grow their beards long, often braiding them into tangled tresses. It is not uncommon for Gozran priests to grow their beards or hair to provide nesting material for small, local creatures, matting their hair over several months before cutting this hair to create small nests. Only the occasional priest houses small birds, frogs, or rodents in their hair while it is still attached.",
								"The most devout members of Gozreh's faith stay as far from civilization as possible, living deep in the woods or on barren coastal shores. Those who are more sociable often take positions on ships, where they serve as navigators and are seen as good luck charms who can help the ships avoid the fiercest of storms. These \"gale-speakers\" come ashore only to change to another vessel and are highly sought after by ship captains. Gale-speakers are not bought, however, choosing their own journeys and favoring vessels with far-flung destinations, waters rarely touched by anything but the Wind and the Waves."

								"Iomedae, the youngest among the prominent deities of the Inner Sea region, had already proven herself worthy of divinity before her ascension. Born in Cheliax, she followed the path of the sword and fought evil, eventually becoming a paladin of Aroden's herald Arazni. She became a legend among the Shining Crusade, leading the Knights of Ozem in a series of victories over the Whispering Tyrant. Iomedae became the third known mortal to pass the Test of the Starstone when she ascended to divinity in 3832 ar. As Arazni had been slain during the Shining Crusade, Aroden elevated the newly ascended goddess to be his new herald. When Aroden himself died, Iomedae inherited most of his worshippers and became a major deity of honor and justice.",
								"Iomedae's followers heed her call to take up arms against evil and fight wickedness for the majority of their lives. This may take the form of physical combat against the likes of fiends, undead, and other sinister creatures, but devotion to the Inheritor also manifests as individuals fighting against adversity, oppression, or injustice through their own personal methods. Wherever courage, righteousness, and valor are needed, Iomedae's followers thrive. Iomedae is popular among lawful good adventurers, and those who worship her sometimes show their faith by wearing a thin white chasuble over their normal adventuring gear.",
								"The Inheritor does not see herself as deity of war, but she places great value on prowess at arms and is patron to many military orders, and her saints are known for their combat skill. As the only woman who has ascended to divinity through the Test of the Starstone, she offers a haven for women fleeing from cruel partners, slave masters, and other oppressors. Many of these women grow to become skilled knights in their own right or earn positions of great influence within her church.",
								"Iomedae's favored weapon is the longsword, and while it is not required of them, many of her priests and champions refuse to use any other weapon. In fact, swords are so important to her faith that they are engraved on the wedding rings of the faithful, and the dead are buried with small sword tokens or even just a scrap of paper marked with a sword. They eschew the practice of burying an actual sword with the dead, however; swords are instead passed down to a family member or a student who has need of them, or are donated to a temple for use by priests and holy knights. The only exception is when a sword has become damaged beyond repair or where magic or some other influence keeps the sword tied to its wielder. Even in these cases, such swords have a habit of turning up in moments of great need, as if Iomedae herself charged it with continuing its duties. Armor is of similar importance to Iomedaeans, and they are rarely buried in their armor. Many bequeath suits of armor to loved ones so they can continue to serve Iomedae's cause.",
								"Priests of Iomedae often travel, usually with a circle: a group of 10 to 50 individuals under the charge of a sword knight. Many priests serve on the front lines of battle, directly combating evils themselves or aiding others who share their cause. Priests in cities keep their ears tuned for crime and work to stamp it out. Those who can't endure the rigors of battle or choose a more peaceful path often work in courtrooms, serve as advisors to nobles and local leaders, or train the next generation of crusaders. Iomedae's churches are rarely staffed directly by champions, clerics, or priests, as most prefer to remain active in their work. Instead, layfolk and acolytes serve at most churches within cities, though some crusaders become the wards of shrines and temples in more remote regions.",
								"Iomedae's holy days include Ascendance Day, which marks the day she passed the Test of the Starstone; Inheritor's Ascendance, which marks the day she became Aroden's herald; the Day of the Inheritor, which marks her assumption of Aroden's mantle; Remembrance Moon, a holiday commemorating the fallen in the Shining Crusade against the Whispering Tyrant; and Armasse, an ancient festival that includes jousts, duels, and other tests of arms. She also upholds the day of Mourningfell, where those who remember Arazni solemnly mourn her death at Tar-Baphon's hands. Much of her faith surrounds a document called the Acts of Iomedae, which details 11 miracles she performed as a mortal paladin. Iomedae manifests as a resplendent knight in shining armor. As she was born in Cheliax, she appears as a woman of Taldan ethnicity, fully armed and ready for battle."

								"Irori exemplifies the concepts of self-perfection. His dogma states that he was a mortal who gained godhood through achieving a physical and mental state that surpassed mortal limitations. His followers seek to emulate their god's divine state by perfecting themselves using the words of the Unbinding of Fetters, Irori's sacred text. The illuminated pages of the tome detail numerous physical, spiritual, and mental exercises, as well as methods of learning and remembering.",
								"In addition to self-perfection, Irori is the god of history and knowledge, perfectly knowing the universe around him. He encourages his followers to follow suit and learn all they can about the world and what lies beyond. Even though Irori perfected himself, he is also a patient and kind teacher. He and his clergy allow each student to learn in a way that fits them by offering a multitude of practices and methods.",
								"As the Master of Masters, Irori teaches that a person is composed of a unified body, mind, and spirit. When one masters all three aspects of themselves as one, they see the Triune Self. To most mortals, the body and mind are more easily known than the spirit, so study begins there. Success gained from mastering the body and mind is then used to penetrate the secrets of the spirit and attain enlightenment. The search for perfection leads many followers to the priesthood, where they wander as solitary monks or dwell in secluded monasteries in endless practice. Many of these monasteries are sprawling complexes closed to the general public. The faithful pray, sleep, exercise, and study in their seemingly endless quest of perfection and purity, often taking vows of poverty and silence. Other temple complexes provide guidance and training to visitors in exchange for tithes and donations. Some of Irori's worshippers instead wander alone, strengthening their connection to Irori by giving up the distraction of material goods and living in caves, forests, or even graveyards. These ascetics may go naked or wear rags, and locals often believe they have mystical abilities. Despite their appearance, these worshippers are well respected among Iroran faithful.",
								"It is said that enlightened members of Irori's clergy are so self-aware they know when the hour of their death approaches. In preparation for this moment, some faithful ingest a diet of poisonous teas and nuts to perform self-mummification. This ritual allows them to watch over their monasteries after death and come to the aid of the faithful if necessary. Others, particularly those considered the most devout, seemingly disappear from the mortal world. These supposedly handpicked individuals are said to \"walk with the Master,\" becoming divine servants of Irori.",
								"In addition to a priest's search for self-perfection, the clergy of Irori still live and participate in worldly cycles. Monk-priests often act as historians and chroniclers for a region, and the libraries of Iroran monasteries house ancient and occult knowledge, making them popular among bards and sages. Elder clergy take this role to heart, gathering and storing knowledge for the sake of knowledge. Irori espouses that all knowledge is worth knowing and cares not for how it is used, except when it would create a loss of self-control. This seeming indifference to good or evil can put Irori's faithful at odds with more dogmatic churches.",
								"When ministering to layfolk, priests of Irori act as guides and shepherds, nudging worshippers to improve themselves. Some worshippers focus on one or two aspects of Irori's teachings and methods to become great unarmed warriors and gladiators, while others study medicine and philosophy exclusively. Even others study the history of the world or a given kingdom or region.",
								"Because of Irori's perfect nature, his followers tend not to depict him in art, believing that any depiction of the Master of Masters would pale in comparison to his actual appearance. Instead they use song and poetry to praise the indescribable flawlessness of their god. They describe him as a Vudrani man with dark skin, clad in simple robes and wooden shoes. Long hair worn in a simple braid sprouts from his otherwise bald head, the braid often wrapped around his neck as a necklace."

								"Lamashtans spread their goddess's doctrine via a variety of paths. Warriors protect the brood alongside their monstrous siblings. Healers focus on keeping followers alive through multiple births and are talented in ensuring wounds form atrocious scars. Caretakers with the strength to manage the church's monstrous children are rewarded with blessings by the goddess to aid them in their duties. Worshippers of all kinds are likely to venture into the world as missionaries, recruiting shunned individuals and forsaken communities to benefit the prosperity of the brood.",
								"When those not among Lamashtu's faithful feel her presence, it is an omen of unimaginable misfortune. Communities subjugated by monsters and demons may find themselves pleading with Lamashtu to spare them from her children's wrath. Expectant parents who wake in the night from traumatizing nightmares fear what horrors their offspring may bring.",
								"Lamashtu's obsessive creation of new monsters promises to reshape the mortal world into a sinister menagerie of vile corruptors. Her devotees join a family of all manner of demons and beasts with the goal to cultivate and glorify the loathsome. To the world that ostracizes them, Lamashtans offer this ultimatum: join the brood, or perish under its might."

								"To some, magic is a powerful weapon. To others, it's a malleable tool. And to a few, it's a source of purpose. With an understanding of spellcasting, creatures can cause fire to erupt from their hands, call otherworldly beings to aid them, bewitch the senses, and even bring the dead back to life. The ability to reshape reality to better suit one's needs and desires is a powerful call that most only dream of being able to answer, and few are ever able to truly master such might.",
								"One such master was Nethys, who was revered as a god-king in ancient Osirion. Having sought to unlock all of the secrets and potential held within the planes and beyond, Nethys shattered his own mind from the sheer overload of knowledge to which he was exposed. Witnessing all of creation, the secrets of the universe, and the vast expanse of what has been seen and will be seen rent his mind in the same moment he elevated to the status of a god. Nethys gained unlimited power and the skill to utilize it, but at the cost of his core self and mental security. This resulted in a split soul, two sides warring within the same body. One seeks to destroy the world, to purge it through fire and ruin, and to conquer all that exists. The other attempts to protect the world, to elevate and educate, and to release it from its limits.",
								"Those who encounter Nethys typically describe him as unpredictable. His shifts in mood and outlook, which occur without reason, often make interactions with him strained. Yet despite the difficulties, he teaches those who seek him out, regardless of their intent. So long as they strive to use magic, to explore its limitless potential, they can earn Nethys' patronage. From the vilest curses to the purest remedies, magic and its continued use seem to be the only drive Nethys maintains. This is often reflected in his followers, who may seek to uncover all they can about the arcane by crafting new uses for existing spells, or to simplify mundane tasks through magical means. Using magic whenever possible is an often-practiced tenet of Nethys's followers. Some of the more zealous followers take it to the fullest extent, opting to use magic for doing all their household tasks at once, utilizing only magical sources of light, or constantly providing themselves with a light breeze.",
								"Nethys's worshippers seek to gain greater knowledge and expand upon their powers. While the majority of his faithful welcome those who seek to learn and understand magic, a fair portion actively shun those without the talent or patience for it. Many followers push for others to learn, often withholding the full answers to questions and offering just enough information to lead others to seek out the answers themselves and learn from their own pursuits. Some instead guard their knowledge jealously, hoping to ensure their own understanding far outpaces that of others who chase similar knowledge. It is common for the followers of Nethys to come off as aloof or indifferent, perhaps even mirroring the god of magic by attempting to balance the world around them, allowing disaster that could be prevented while bringing structure where it is lacking. Most refrain from politics, instead choosing to take impartial viewpoints that do not require taking hard stances, though a Nethysian's neutral stance makes them perfect advisors for rulers dealing with magic-related issues.",
								"Standalone temples constructed solely for the worship of Nethys are rare. Instead, many double as libraries and studies, and preexisting libraries and colleges often hold shrines to Nethys within. Most of these temples are grandiose edifices whose imposing nature suggest architecture only capable with the aid of magic. In fact, many of the caretakers of such sites take pride in the unique spells required in the creation of the more elaborate temples of Nethys. A few more remote locations hold small shrines to Nethys, often containing small traveling libraries along with various scraps of research that might spur those who stop and partake to pursue new knowledge, though such shrines are particularly rare. These shrines and their libraries are constructed by followers who actively roam the lands in search of new secrets. Priests of Nethys commonly wear contrasting colors, often one light and one dark, or take to painting or tattooing one half of their body to better represent the duality of the god of magic."

Unlike Iomedae's and Cayden Cailean's mortal existences, Norgorber's life before his ascension is a mystery; the god himself has shrouded details of his mortal life in secrecy. This is no surprise to those familiar with Norgorber\u2014he is the master of all secrets, a calculating manipulator who cleverly and ruthlessly wields the power of hidden knowledge to achieve his own ends. Only his most trusted worshippers know enough about his goals to assist in the god's plans, and even those worshippers often have their memories modified after their parts in Norgorber's schemes are complete.",
								"In artwork, Norgorber is often portrayed merely by his religious symbol: a black, featureless mask. The god actively interferes in artists' attempts to realistically reproduce his likeness by causing blindness or tremors to prevent completion of their work. Those who claim to have seen him can describe only a nondescript hooded figure in black and gray, with his face lost in shadows.",
								"Norgorber is worshipped in four aspects, each of which embodies a facet of the god's sinister portfolio: Blackfingers, god of poison; Father Skinsaw, god of murder; the Gray Master, god of thieves; and the Reaper of Reputation, god of secrets. Norgorber's followers typically align themselves with one aspect above the others, though some temples venerate the god in all of his guises. Temples dedicated to different aspects of the god operate independently, though they might work together to accomplish complicated schemes planned by the god or his minions.",
								"{@b Blackfingers:} In his aspect as the god of alchemists and poisoners, Norgorber represents the covert use of dangerous substances to achieve personal gain and the pursuit of alchemical secrets regardless of the consequences. Even alchemists who worship more benevolent gods covet the secrets known by Blackfingers, though his worshippers would contend that nonbelievers are too cautious or kindhearted to successfully pursue Norgorber's forbidden techniques. Followers of Blackfingers are reckless experimenters, selectively breeding spiders or scorpions to develop stronger venoms or testing chemical tinctures on prisoners to study their effects. Their experiments often lead to the development of useful contraband, such as untraceable poisons that mimic the effects of disease or powerful acids that eat through locks or prison bars.",
								"{@b Father Skinsaw:} Bloodthirsty and brutally violent, Norgorber's Father Skinsaw aspect is worshipped by only the most heartless killers. Whether they're merciless bandits, cutthroat thieves, or fearsome butchers, followers of Father Skinsaw focus on snuffing out life, either as a show of dominance, a gruesome sacrament, or a celebration of depravity. While senseless killing is enough for many worshippers of Father Skinsaw, some serial killers see their crimes as steps in the unknowable plans of their dark god. For them, every murder is a prayer.}",
								"{@b The Gray Master:} Blackmail, extortion, larceny, kidnapping\u2014all of these are sacred to followers of the Gray Master. Norgorber's aspect as the god of thieves encourages his followers to seize what they can get and disregard moral compunctions and the law. While individual guilds of thieves might follow guidelines that ensure profitability or help them avoid authorities, those that follow the Gray Master seek to profit at the expense of others. Of all the god's aspects, the Gray Master is the most likely to have organized cults of followers, and his priests often hold important positions in thieves' guilds, gangs, and crime syndicates.",
								"{@b The Reaper of Reputation:} Politicians, spymasters, and even archivists or researchers might worship Norgorber as this, his least malevolent aspect. The Reaper of Reputation represents the power of information: the power of discovering it, the power of keeping it secret, and the power of whispering it in the right ear at the right time. While many good people are interested in gathering useful information, those who follow the Reaper of Reputation usually do so to further their own selfish ends and seek to leverage insider knowledge for personal gain. Price manipulation and political corruption are the trade of many of the Reaper of Reputation's followers, but his most extreme worshippers might ferret out a secret and then kill anyone who had learned of it, merely to keep its power for themselves."

								"No record of history, and not even other gods, can recall a time before Pharasma. Her throne lies within a vast, gothic cathedral located on the infinite Spire at the center of the planes. From here, she looks both forward and backward in time, observing the births, lives, and deaths of every soul, as she serves as the final arbiter of a soul's destination after death. Psychopomp servants of Pharasma guide and safeguard newly dead souls along the River of Souls to her realm, where she judges each soul and ensures it is sent to the proper plane for its afterlife, according to its alignment and mortal deeds. Although she can see all possible fates and knows the fate of each individual, free will and choice can alter a soul's final destination, and she places great weight on the individual's actions and personal choices. Therefore, Pharasma withholds her final judgment until a soul stands before her. Her prophecies are cryptic, and their full meanings are rarely revealed until the foretold events occur.",
								"Once Pharasma has judged a soul, it can no longer be returned from the dead by mortal magics such as raise dead or resurrect. While it may be within Pharasma's power to do so, she has never withheld a soul from its proper destination\u2014not even from the realms of gods she may despise. She embraces her role with a dispassionate dignity that often makes her seem aloof or uncaring, but in truth she simply understands the necessity of impartiality to sustain the cycle of life and balance throughout the planes. Almost all other deities show Pharasma great deference, for she is the only one they trust to unfailingly distribute souls to their proper planes.",
								"Pharasma abhors the creation of undead and magic that traps souls, preventing them from arriving in her realm for judgment and disrupting the balance of the cycle of souls. She commands her followers to destroy all such abominations and to release any bound souls.",
								"Pharasma is usually portrayed as a tall, ash-skinned woman with white eyes and wild, flowing, white hair, cloaked in dark robes and holding an hourglass filled with red sand. Many dread her as a grim reaper, ready to take their souls at the end of their mortal existences. Yet many also worship her as the guardian of birth and new souls, a wise scholar, and a healer. These worshippers call her The Mother of Souls, a title reflecting her protective and guiding nature. Pharasma's religious symbol depicts a silver-and-blue spiraling comet, which signifies the bright and winding path of every soul's potential.",
								"While her faithful most often wear black clothing trimmed in purple or silver during rituals, they are also fond of wearing brilliant shades of silver, blue, and purple throughout their daily lives and during sacred rites celebrating birth and life. Midwives and physicians carry silver religious symbols of Pharasma on long chains when they go to bless newborn children or say prayers over the dying. Scholars and oracles embroider Pharasma's spiral or an hourglass to represent their belief in fate, prophecy, or observation of time. Those devout to Pharasma are generally circumspect when it comes to taking sides in politics or conflicts. Priests of Pharasma can frequently be found blessing, healing, and tending to the dead on rival sides of disputes, battles, and even wars with equal efficiency.",
								"Places of worship dedicated to Pharasma range from the simplistic to the ostentatious. Mausoleums and crypts usually contain at least a token idol or shrine dedicated to Pharasma. Shrines to her can be as simple as a carved stone on a river island or within a graveyard. However, Pharasma's temples are towering, gothic cathedrals decorated with stained glass and carved statuary. These temples typically have universities, hospitals, and immense libraries attached above ground, and vast, deep catacombs intricately decorated with the bones of the deceased below. Wealthy patrons and scholars pay membership fees to access knowledge and wisdom within her temples. Since being interred within the catacombs of Pharasma is deemed a blessing, they also contribute sizable donations to secure prominent locations for their bodies' later interment in the crypts, often as an attempt to gain favor during Pharasma's judgment of their soul in the afterlife. It is not uncommon for entire libraries or estates to be donated to the church of Pharasma from the deathbeds of the rich and powerful concerned with how their mortal deeds will reflect upon their immortal soul."

								"Rovagug has no single holy scripture. He has little use for one, for his sole commandment is to destroy, and his followers need no instruction in how to accomplish that. The figurative and literal monsters who worship Rovagug share their myths and legends in secret shrines and hidden caves, calling him the Rough Beast, the Imprisoned King, the Tide of Fangs, the Unmaker, and the Worldbreaker. They tell each other that each life they snuff out, each piece of art they destroy, each work of labor they bring tumbling down puts a crack in the prison that holds their god. Each of their little efforts of destruction adds up and will one day free him, setting him loose to bring about the end of all things.",
								"They tell of how Rovagug crawled millennia ago from beyond the depths of the universe, leaving only devastation in his wake. An endless number of lesser gods fell before him, devoured in his massive maw or crushed beneath his unholy bulk. His worshippers whisper in anger of a cowardly alliance of the other gods, who couldn't hope to stop him alone: While sly Calistria distracted the Rough Beast, foul Torag, weak Gorum, and judgmental Pharasma conspired to forge an unbreakable prison in the heart of Gods of the Inner Sea. Arrogant Sarenrae had the temerity to challenge Rovagug directly. She used holy fire to lure him close to the world that would be his prison before finally slicing a great rift on the surface that drew him in. Only then did cowardly, smug Asmodeus seal Rovagug in the Cage, taunting him with the Hell-forged key.",
								"Still, his worshippers say, this prison merely contains Rovagug, and only for now. He sleeps fitfully, his shudders causing the earth to tremble and mountains to fall, his cries of rage spewing noxious gases to poison his enemies' followers. His flesh births and sustains horrors undreamed of, parasites with the power to wreak destruction above. The deadliest of these\u2014great spawn such as Festering Ulunat, the Unholy First; Chemnosit, the Monarch Worm; Xotani, the Firebleeder; and Tarrasque, the Armageddon Engine\u2014are almost gods in their own rights, laying waste to Gods of the Inner Sea and leaving nothing but destruction in their wakes. They have caused catastrophes on a scale most of the Rough Beast's followers only dream of, monstrous steps toward setting Rovagug free to feast on the gods who locked him away.",
								"While most of Rovagug's followers simply seek an end to all, his most extreme worshippers believe they will be uplifted as gods in a new world Rovagug will create after destroying the old. In truth, the Rough Beast cares nothing for them. He cares only about destruction and bringing an end to all things. Should the day come that his prison fails, he would, after enacting his vengeance on the other gods, turn on his own spawn and followers, devouring them as surely as all else.",
								"Rovagug's faith is forbidden in civilized lands, where no temple to him is allowed to stand. The Rough Beast's worshippers revel in the hatred of the other gods and their faithful. Creatures who take up Rovagug's service live to destroy. Most are monsters or hail from communities that celebrate destruction; they cry out paeans to the god as they cut through lesser creatures in howling fits of rage. A few individuals\u2014all somewhat monstrous in their own right\u2014follow Rovagug in their lust for the power that they believe even the other gods fear, or in the mistaken belief that the obliteration the god promises would clear the way for a new birth. Even they know enough to not name their deity in the open, however, lest they be swiftly cut down.",
								"The few adventurers who follow Rovagug cherish destruction, laying waste to as much as they can. They may be warlords, cultists seeking to open the locks of Rovagug's prison, warriors who have seen such horrors that they can envision only destruction, or vengeful souls who want an end for themselves and all who have hurt them."

								"Sarenrae is one of the most popular deities on Gods of the Inner Sea by virtue of her association with the life-giving sun and her perpetual offer to help anyone be their best, even when they have made mistakes. Most people thank her for her kind work to channel the sun's power for everyone's safety and livelihood, and thank her clergy for granting her healing power to all who need it. Mortals look to the Dawnflower as an example of boundless love, exquisite kindness, and true patience. They pray to her to heal the sick, lift up the downtrodden, and illuminate darkness of circumstance as well as darkness of spirit. Her followers aspire to emulate her through generosity, nurturing, truthfulness, and selfless courage. They oppose evil everywhere with words first, and when necessary, with scimitar and flame.",
								"Sarenrae is also much revered as a symbol of renewed hope, having selflessly led the charge against Rovagug to save Gods of the Inner Sea from utter destruction in the mythic past. It was she who cast Rovagug into his terrible tomb within the world and set the fire of the sun within his prison to weaken the Rough Beast and prevent his escape. She has the aspect of an angel, having originated as one of the mightiest angels before establishing herself as a true deity, and she resumes this aspect of a burning avenger when she encounters evil too entrenched for even her to redeem it.",
								"Sarenrae's holy text is {@i The Birth of Light and Truth}. It records her struggles as an angel before mortal history began and also offers guidance on resisting evils of convenience, standing against cruelty in the world, and teaching and redeeming an evil soul. Preachers often publicly cite the text in passionate sermons when condemning cruelty and corruption, giving the faithful a reputation as fiery zealots. In places like Qadira, this puts many of her followers in conflict with those in power who allow or even support evils like slavery\u2014in recent times, she has stripped her blessings from those among the faith who condoned such evils, though after the Dawnflower's temper cooled, she has publicly offered redemption to disgraced faithful who are willing to repent.",
								"The church of Sarenrae is devoted to healing all ills, nourishing body and spirit, and correcting evils. It is a flexible, quasi-familial organization that calls its members to go where they are needed. Most people recognize Sarenrae's bright, soaring temples, which allow services to be performed in direct sunlight. The largest tend to incorporate Keleshite architecture, as in many areas Sarenrae's faith spread ahead of Kelesh's economic expansion. Sarenite services are traditionally joyous, with singing and dancing. Milestones in familybuilding and personal growth are especially celebrated, including adoption, marriages, coming of age, and recognizing a former evildoer as rehabilitated.",
								"Clergy are called to do many kinds of good in the world. They feed the hungry, tend the ill, heal the injured, and guide the lost. Many are trained as diplomats and advisers in the hope of maintaining peace and ensuring that governments are just and merciful. They also counsel those with torn spirits, mediate disputes, and rehabilitate those who have wronged others. Although most day-to-day work of the church is peaceful, its members practice swordplay and magic both as a form of meditative art and as preparation to strike down irredeemable evil with merciful speed.",
								"Those who have done great wrongs but feel regret sometimes join Sarenrae's church because the goddess offers a chance at redemption even to people who have committed terrible evils. The reflective and intimate Candlemark holiday on the winter solstice\u2014celebrating the personal reasons that each individual follower joined the church\u2014has special significance to these followers, as well as new practitioners and those in trying times."

								"{@indentFirst {@b Love and beauty belong to all:} All beings are capable and worthy of love, even those who have been twisted or corrupted by such facets of love as jealousy or possessiveness. Love is a power that has the strength to redeem and unite, and it is as varied in meaning as all the creatures who feel it in their hearts.}",
								"{@indentFirst {@b Love is the greatest of all things:} Shelyn's greatest teaching is that love is the most powerful of all forces. It drives the actions of mortals and gods alike, and it endures beyond knowledge, language, and ambitions. Painful emotions such as anger or fear are echoes of a love that is missing, and therefore can be soothed only by love.}"

								"Shelyn watches over existence with a kind and loving eye, encouraging mortals to make the best of their lives by spreading love, art, and beauty as best they can. Even the crudest artistic awakenings are worthy of praise in the goddess's eyes, as they represent an individual's expression of life's trials and triumphs. She believes every creature is worthy of love and capable of creating art in their own way. Shelyn's religion does not require chastity, fidelity, or a particular relationship structure, as the passion of early romance is a facet of love just as important and valid as the comfortable trust between a long-married couple. However, she does make the distinction between courtship and pure carnal desire, and she prefers that trysts blossom into more meaningful relationships along the way.",
								"As the goddess of art and beauty, Shelyn's appearance changes drastically depending on the cultural norms of the artists who depict her. She has been portrayed as nearly every ancestry, though usually with some distinctive similarities: her ankle-length hair is marked with festive rainbow streaks and her eyes are blue, silver, both, or one of each color.",
								"Shelyn's mother is unknown, though some claim she was born of an ancient goddess of love. Shelyn's father was the spirit-wolf Thron, who roamed Gods of the Inner Sea in primordial times singing feral praises to love, life, and the universe. Though Thron had many partners and children, he had only two children who grew to surpass him in power: Shelyn and Dou-Bral. After a fight between the siblings, Dou-Bral rejected his divine responsibilities and disappeared beyond the edge of the Great Beyond. He eventually returned, but changed: possessed by some malevolent spirit and reshaped as the twisted and corrupted lord Zon-Kuthon. The two siblings clashed once more, this time coming to a truce only when Shelyn wrested her brother's gold-plated glaive, Whisperer of Souls, from his hands, believing it to be the source of his corruption. Though Zon -Kuthon remains evil, going so far as to mutilate and reshape his own father into a grotesque herald, Shelyn still believes that her brother exists somewhere beneath the corruption, and she hopes to one day redeem him.",
								"This tragic schism in Shelyn's family contributes to her belief that all creatures deserve love, and that even those who have turned to evil still carry love within them, along with the possibility of healing and redemption. While Zon-Kuthon, Asmodeus, Rovagug, and Urgathoa are sometimes considered enemies of her faith, in truth Shelyn doesn't look at any creature in a way that fits the mortal concept of \"enemy.\" Even evil deities and their faiths tend to look more kindly on Shelyn and her worshippers than they do the other good gods.",
								"While she is well aware that love and art are not easy things and can even be sources of pain at times, she remains a steadfast optimist with the knowledge that even broken hearts may be mended, and that even a turbulent experience with love can be an educational and healing journey. But she also recognizes that some creatures may distort love into jealousy or warp the urge to create into greed or obsession. While she appreciates passion and perseverance in the face of adversity, Shelyn never asks her followers to forsake the well-being of themselves or others to pine obsessively, aggressively pursue an uninterested person, or endanger themselves for art. It is equally important to her followers to spread love as it is to correct those who would use Shelyn's name to justify selfish, covetous, or cruel deeds.",
								"Shelynites gather at her temples on the holy day of Crystalhue, a winter celebration full of creation, friendly gatherings, and courtship. Many couples get engaged or married on Crystalhue, and the temples host grand feasts in the evening for the whole community to gather and enjoy food, company, and performances long into the night. No matter the season, Shelyn's temples are adorned with flowers, art, and images of her religious symbol: a songbird with vibrant rainbow tail feathers."

								"The head of the dwarven pantheon is the most visible of the dwarven deities, to the extent that Torag is the only dwarven deity most non-dwarves know of. While the other dwarven gods represent specific areas of dwarven life and culture, thus forming an expansive and comprehensive dwarven pantheon, Torag's areas of concern are those most central to dwarven society. In his own family, Torag models the values of community and protection that have cemented deeprooted relationships among dwarven clans. His focus on strategy and tactical acumen centers on protection, reflected in dwarves' impenetrable fortresses and conservative military tactics, including their willingness to use offensive maneuvers as a form of defense. He also represents the forge: the creation of fine works from raw materials, practice and mastery of a craft, and pride in one's work. His purview extends even to those activities that feed the forge and dwarven artisanship, such as mining the earth for raw ore and gemstones. Torag's oversight over these core concepts has secured his place at the head of the dwarven pantheon for ages. It was Torag who sent the dwarves on their legendary Quest for Sky during the Age of Darkness, and his worship was longestablished even then. Indeed, among dwarves, Torag is often called the Father of Creation.",
								"Worship of Torag centers around the forge, literally and figuratively. Many sites of worship include an active forge, and crafting is incorporated into worship services. The god's teachings urge the faithful to continually practice and improve their artistry, regardless of their specific craft. Though metalworking is the most iconic skill, Toragdans also appreciate and encourage masonry, leatherworking, gem cutting, cooking, brewing, and virtually every other pragmatic craft. Refining one's techniques and improving skills are highly valued among Torag's followers, and this pursuit of quality and betterment is an aspect that draws many non-dwarves to the faith.",
								"A forge means nothing without the community around it, and as a result, Torag's followers hold family, friends, and the wider society to be of utmost importance. This aspect of Torag's faith has attracted the worship of no small number of non-dwarves seeking a faith that focuses on bettering or protecting one's own society.",
								"It comes as no surprise that Torag places a strong emphasis on defense and combat prowess in the name of protecting one's community. Followers of Torag are expected to train in martial techniques and lead in the defense of the home\u2014including, with no reservations, offense against the community's enemies. Even so, the emphasis remains on protection, and Torag's focus on the use of military might for defense rather than conquest and glory is a key component in dwarves' tendency to remain ensconced in their fortresses and existing territories rather than expanding their borders.",
								"Torag encourages his followers to develop their skills in tactics, planning, and forethought, but he also supports the ability to think on one's feet and respond in the moment to the chaos of combat. Tales of the god's exploits in battle tell of his calm and collected demeanor, rarely losing his temper\u2014a temperament that his worshippers seek to emulate.",
								"Torag's church celebrates family events, such as marriages, births of children, and deaths. Stability, tradition, and orthodoxy are ingrained in the church, with values conveyed through legend and storytelling. Clerics and priests are thus central pillars of a dwarven community. Dwarven champions of Torag thrive, typically as paladins serving at the forefront of a community's military operations, and these champions' merciless devastation of their community's enemies is a terrifying sight. Toragdans believe in destroying the community's enemies, lest showing mercy lead to further bloodshed down the line, which makes being a redeemer virtually impossible to the faithful of Torag. When a dwarven settlement needs to address a far-off challenge, it is often champions who take up the task. In areas with few dwarves, encounters with these roaming faithful are sometimes the only interactions non-dwarves have with followers of Torag."

								"The chosen of Urgathoa do not dread the flaws of mortal flesh, such as aging, disease, or even death, for so long as they indulge in excess above all else, their goddess offers eternal freedom from such fickle constraints. Urgathoa herself was once a mortal woman who challenged and rejected the tenets of deities whose followers expected mindless conformity, temperance, and restraint. Why would the gods craft Gods of the Inner Sea into a near -endless buffet abundant with pleasures of the body and mind if the living weren't destined to feast from it? Urgathoa so loved satiating her life's appetites that in death, she spat in the face of Pharasma's judgment, murdered the psychopomp assigned to aid her transition to the afterlife, and tore herself from the Boneyard with a feat of will that not only returned her to the Material Plane but also transformed her into the first divine undead creature.",
								"Urgathoa demands that her faithful reject moderation and self-restraint at all costs, instead urging reckless gluttony, constant experimentation, and the relentless pursuit of appetites of the flesh. Above all, Urgathoa's children must feed their endless hunger. They must dine from every great hall, striving to fully satiate their cravings as they feast, for every morsel bears a sacred truth gleaned only from its consumption. Her followers should taste the flesh and drink the lifeblood of other sapient creatures to discover what hidden thirsts their essence might quench. Only the weak fear to indulge those yearnings they mislabel as strange and taboo, for even poison can be savored as a sweet nectar upon the tongue if one is strong enough to relish its torment. Disease and infection are but tests of her followers' conviction and should be willingly contracted and endured, as Urgathoa reveals her most treasured secrets in the fevered dreams that often accompany these afflictions. Undeath\u2014seen by so many as a perversion of the mortal form\u2014is the ultimate transcendence beyond the body's limitations, for those who defy the hypocrisy of death's judgmental gaze shall never know an existence where their desires remain unfulfilled. Nowhere are these tenets of putting one's personal gratification and sensation first more espoused than in Urgathoa's holy text, {@i Serving Your Hunger}, written by the Pallid Princess's first champion, Dason.",
								"Much like the principles held by members of her church, Urgathoa's existence defies the natural order. She is often depicted as a raven-haired woman wielding an enormous scythe. Her upper torso is clad in skin as pale as a vampire's; her abdomen peels into rotted strips of flesh that expose her entrails; and her pelvis, legs, and feet are torn clean of muscle and flesh, revealing little more than bleached bone. Her clothes, if she wears any, are stained with blood and bile\u2014more often she wears nothing, in a mockery of the carnal form. Some say the footprints left from her first steps upon Gods of the Inner Sea filled with a pestilence so indomitable it has spawned thousands of other plagues as it evolves and adapts, leaving mortals incapable of developing an immunity to it. Others say the first words Urgathoa spoke after returning to the Material Plane stole the breath from the lungs of those who heard them, transforming these poor creatures into wraiths and specters that shared her endless hunger. The faithful hold that her touch can evoke pleasures so great that those who know her embrace never experience a desire for anything else ever again. And should Urgathoa ever bestow a curse upon an individual, her followers believe it can be removed only by gorging in excess on the raw flesh of sapient creatures.",
								"The church of Urgathoa is organized as a matriarchy. Usually, a powerful female cleric presides over each temple, leading a congregation composed mostly of necromancers, undead, or those hoping to eventually become undead. While most worshippers of Urgathoa concern themselves less with spreading her faith than increasing their own pleasure in her name, they often work together to ensure that her temples are devoted to offering experiences rife with pure sensation. Temples with more experienced clerics tend to offer services that can satisfy more peculiar, and often grotesque, hungers. Her faith is illegal in most nations of the Inner Sea region, though she is venerated openly in Geb.",
								"Senior clergy of Urgathoa sometimes practice a ritual known as the Reaping, in which they don clean gray robes and arm themselves with scythes before heading out into the surrounding countryside to deal as much death and destruction as they can upon worshippers of Urgathoa's most hated enemies. During the slaughter, each cleric attempts to inflict wounds that spatter as much blood and gore upon their garments as possible, believing that if Urgathoa is pleased by the results of the Reaping, she will grant a boon to each worshipper who participated. The blood-soaked robes from a successful Reaping are often displayed in temples of Urgathoa as symbols of the goddess's approval of the local clergy's efforts."

								"The Midnight Lord embodies and glorifies pain, shadows, and mutilation, and he is one of the most twisted and malevolent gods on the face of Gods of the Inner Sea. Once known as Dou-Bral, he crafted the immense Star Towers that still help keep Rovagug pinned in his prison at Gods of the Inner Sea's heart, lending his own skill and ability to the great deific alliance to bind that evil entity. Yet a divine argument between him and his sister Shelyn resulted in the god departing for parts unknown. Zon-Kuthon traveled beyond the edges of the multiverse and stared into the face of the incomprehensible things that dwell there. No one knows what he found in that place, but he returned\u2014changed, but claiming to be strengthened by what he had endured. Likewise, the nation of Nidal on Gods of the Inner Sea, which is bound to him, is a nation of survivors, founded by those few strong enough to do what they must so their people could survive the terrible aftermath of Earthfall and the Age of Darkness that followed.",
								"Zon-Kuthon teaches that torment is the ultimate pleasure and sacrament, and that inflicting and enduring pain is the truest strength. Experiencing pain and learning to embrace it allows one to purge the weakness of their body and spirit. After all, much of mortal creatures' fear is rooted in the struggle to avoid pain in one way or another. If a follower can learn to embrace that pain instead, the chains of fear fall away, becoming a tool to be wielded. Worshippers thus endeavor to inflict as much torture and misery as possible on themselves and others; they look to the cruel outsiders known as velstracs for inspiration, including the use of spiked chains as a primary weapon.",
								"The anguish Zon-Kuthon teaches is not limited to physical injury. Zon-Kuthon teaches his followers to understand, overcome, and revel in psychological pain as well, breaking down morality and twisting compassion into numb pragmatism. This is best exemplified by his troubled relationship with his sister Shelyn, who hopes to redeem him despite all evidence as to the impossibility of this task, and his chaining of his own father, breaking the deity's spirit and transforming him into the hateful servitor now known as the Prince in Chains.",
								"Some worship Zon-Kuthon out of necessity, especially in Nidal, where veneration of the Midnight Lord is heavily interwoven into the culture and political landscape, and where deviation from this dark norm generally leads to tragic results. Outside those borders, some contemptible individuals gravitate toward a faith that allows them to embrace and practice their own sadistic desires. Still others find that Zon-Kuthon provides a level of understanding in the face of inescapable pain: to some, the bleak faith offers a means of finding release when faced with an inability to feel.",
								"Zon-Kuthon is cruel, but he is patient, willing to collaborate with others, and unlikely to provoke conflicts with other gods. He keeps to himself, though one might argue that this is more a case of other deities keeping their distance from him. Likewise, his followers tend to keep their own counsel, perhaps seeming aloof to others, but they have no qualms about working with others to achieve shared goals. The god, his church, and his nation on Gods of the Inner Sea all operate within a strict, unyielding hierarchy that followers understand and uphold, each playing their part as dictated by the Midnight Lord's teachings.",
								"Regardless of the worshipper or their reasons for following the Midnight Lord, his worship is terrible and merciless, often bloody, and sometimes deadly. The faithful are often easily identified by their countless scars\u2014many of them self-inflicted in the course of regular prayers\u2014and frequently piercings and other body modifications, though tattoos are relatively rare among Kuthites. More profound, perhaps, is the cold, detached gaze of a truly faithful worshipper, their unflinching calm in the face of imminent danger, and their rapturous acceptance of any harm that befalls them.",
								"Though priests of Zon-Kuthon hold positions of power and respect within Nidal, they are few and far between beyond its borders. Somewhat more common are the infamous shadowcallers, who practice divinely inspired wizardry and other sorts of magic, and vicious itinerant clerics and champions who scour the land in an inquisition, seeking out naysayers and rebels."

								"While Achaekek's divine genesis is heavily debated among scholars, it is believed that he was created\u2014either by the power of a singular deity or a group of them\u2014to eradicate those who would steal a god's divinity, and he has since become the enforcer of divine punishment. Known as He Who Walks in Blood, he slumbers in the blood of heretics and worshippers alike in an immense cleft carved into the base of the Boneyard's spire, a realm known as the Blood Vale. He keeps no formal relationships with any other deities, even his sister, Grandmother Spider, who repeatedly coaxes Achaekek to rebel against the gods and abandon his duties. In response, even though some gods disapprove of Achaekek's methods, few openly defy him.",
								"Many of Achaekek's faithful attribute the Mantis God with a masculine identity, though Achaekek holds himself beyond the mortal conventions of gender just as he eschews ancestry and most mortal affairs. He does not actively seek worshippers, though the Red Mantis assassins' guild devotes itself to tenets curated around his persona and tactics. Red Mantises believe their assassinations are a sacred rite: just as their deity stays his hand against rightful gods, the assassins refuse to strike against rightful rulers\u2014but all others are fair game. Some ferocious druids and rangers worship Achaekek to emulate the god's efficiency in killing their targets. The deity's faith is also known to attract mortals who kill for coin, whether from a hope of someday joining the Red Mantis or at the direction of their own cults or guilds. Regardless of any association with the Red Mantis, priests of Achaekek are expected to act as assassins of some kind when the opportunity arises, whatever their skill or training. This may manifest in an obvious opportunity presaged by an omen from Achaekek, such as a mantis resting on the shoulder of a public speaker, or a more direct message from Red Mantis agents. Achaekek's followers believe assassination for the sake of self defense or vengeance does not require any sort of payment. However, assassins who kill for reasons that do not involve any personal interest or personal advancement deserve appropriate compensation, at least in the eyes of Achaekek's faithful."

								"Alseta holds sway over transitions. Physical transitions through doorways and portals or over thresholds, metaphorical transitions, and even the forward flow of time\u2014Alseta influences them all. She watches over city gates, helping keep invaders out and defenders safe. She also watches over those moving into a new stage in life, whether that means a birthday, a marriage, or a more fitting body. It is common for anyone entering into a life change, such as moving to a new town or changing careers, to look to Alseta for guidance. Likewise, birth and death are both transitions, and expectant mothers and the bereaved both offer her prayers, linking Alseta's church to that of Pharasma. Some consider Alseta to be the goddess of teleportation, though she does not officially claim that title. She is also a popular god among some elven nations and cultures, who frequently associate Alseta with the aiudara, or elf gates, around Gods of the Inner Sea.",
								"As the Welcomer, Alseta also believes in courtesy. She treats every being, from the smallest animal to the most powerful gods, with civility and respect, and she expects that same treatment in return. She also expects her followers to follow suit and use courtesy when interacting with others. Alseta's followers typically include diplomats, negotiators, and other members of local governing bodies. Alsetan priests are noted for their fair and impartial interactions with others, and many of them are called on to aid locals or even other churches with resolving disputes or to oversee important ceremonies.",
								"Alseta most often appears as a kindly older woman wearing a smiling mask on the back of her head. She wears simple clothing, usually colored gray. When she speaks, she does so with carefully considered words. Her voice carries tremendous authority and wisdom, and the weight of it is hard to ignore."

								"More than anything, Arazni is a survivor. Once, long ago, she was a force for good, a warrior-mage who sought to improve the quality of life for residents of her homeland. Long after her mortal death, she returned as a herald of the god Aroden and fought alongside mortals during one of their darkest hours. But humanity and her patron alike abandoned her\u2014first to the Whispering Tyrant, then to the necromancer Geb\u2014and the torments she endured because of it changed her deeply. Still she survived, her broken body reanimated against her will as a powerful undead monstrosity. For over a millennium she was held captive as the lich queen of the undead nation of Geb, and her view of mortals, and humanity in particular, soured.",
								"Only recently was Arazni able to reclaim her autonomy, manipulating the Whispering Tyrant into using his own magic to shatter her arcane bonds. The Unyielding defends her reclaimed freedom with unparalleled vigor, scorns those who supplicate her, and exacts swift retribution against those who wrong her. She treats petitioners who honored her in her despised role as queen of Geb, or who pray to her only now that she has reclaimed her power, with pure contempt. Arazni might have learned the art of unflinching cruelty and found ways to embrace and savor what power she had as a means of self defense, but she holds a deep -seated disdain for those who think that what she has become is worthy of veneration.",
								"Arazni feels little kinship with either humanity or undead, save a faint affinity to those who have been denied agency as she was. She also recognizes, grudgingly, that the Knights of Lastwall share her hatred of the Whispering Tyrant; a number of these dispossessed knights, disenchanted and embittered by the failure of their leaders to keep Tar -Baphon imprisoned, even consider Arazni something of a patron. Yet these disparate followers are few and far between, less a church and more a scattering of worshippers who see in the Unyielding something of themselves."

								"Once nothing more than a powerful spirit of water with the ability to manipulate sea monsters, Besmara grew slowly in power over the centuries from sacrifices made by seafaring people. After defeating and consuming rival spirits of battle, gold, and wood, she became a minor god of piracy, strife, and sea monsters.",
								"Besmara, the Pirate Queen, cuts a brash and bold figure, as she often is depicted wearing buccaneer apparel consisting of loose-fitting, eye-catching clothing and black boots, and her hair is wind-tossed on even the calmest day. She and her followers adhere to a simple code of greed: take what you desire, no matter who it might belong to. Despite this, Besmara and her worshippers are generally loyal to one another, knowing that while on the waves raiding ships for treasure, a pirate crew can survive only if its members trust one another.",
								"Besmara is no fool, though. She knows to fall back if obtaining a certain treasure proves too difficult; in fact, she currently bides her time, waiting for an opportunity to gain more deific power, even while she steals from other minor divinities. She is not above fighting dirty if she believes it will give her the upper hand in a battle, and she sometimes encourages her followers to foment conflict between other groups so they can take advantage of the ensuing chaos. Besmara thrives in areas where piracy is difficult to control or even encouraged, such as Ilizmagorti and the Shackles, and her followers chafe at any laws that would curtail their personal freedoms.",
								"Most of Besmara's followers are those who live their lives in and around the seas of Gods of the Inner Sea, typically pirates or others whose livelihood relies on piracy. This includes both the vilest of high-seas murderers and the privateers who seek them out. However, even non-followers utter prayers to the Pirate Queen as they set sail or as storms approach. Besmara rarely cares when those of other faiths are at sea, so long as she receives respect and her fair share of tribute from treasure."

								"Brigh's exact origins are unknown, though her priests and various religious scholars have many theories on the matter. Some believe she was a construct who achieved consciousness and a spark of divinity, while others think she was a human alchemist and inventor who discovered ways to fuse mechanical components with her own physiology. Regardless of her origins, Brigh is a patient and thoughtful god who promotes unending curiosity and constant intellectual advancement. Her two most common forms are a humanoid woman made of bronze clockwork and a human woman wearing a bronze skullcap and armor composed of gears and other movable metal pieces. Though Brigh's usual demeanor is composed and reserved, she isn't an unfeeling automaton; she deeply cherishes the creations she and her followers make, and most of her worshippers feel the same way.",
								"Brigh's faith isn't as widespread as that of most other gods, though she does have pockets of worship in areas where machinery and constructs are common. Among these are Alkenstar, where much of that city's production of firearms is overseen by priests of Brigh; Numeria, where the proliferation of strange technological artifacts draws followers of the Whisper in Bronze like moths to a flame; and Absalom, where the mysterious Clockwork Cathedral teaches the crafts of mechanical engineering and construct-building to eager students. Brigh encourages her faithful to improve upon the work of others and allow others to build on their own achievements in turn. Typical followers of Brigh are those who work with their hands, especially gem cutters, inventors, and toy makers. Numerous gnomes are drawn to her religion, thanks to its emphasis on searching for new and exciting innovations. Many of her followers dedicate their lives to research and projects of great scope, crafting magnificent inventions that take years to create. Other followers are content with creating smaller inventions or tinkering with those of others. Brigh is pleased regardless of the size of the project, so long as new technologies and discoveries result from the work."

								"Casandalee is an unusual god, one who achieved divinity through a merging of advanced science and faith. Formerly an artificial intelligence cloned from the mind of an android from outer space, Casandalee gained her godhood in the heart of Numeria within the computer core of a crashed spaceship, becoming the patron of artificial life, free thinking, and intellectual apotheosis.",
								"Though she is sometimes referred to as the Iron Goddess, Casandalee is much more than simple metal. She sometimes appears as a holographic reconstruction of her android form: a female humanoid with purple hair, blue lips, and pale skin traced with glowing circuitry, but upon close inspection, this image seems to consist of millions of complex algorithms of pure light. Casandalee and her followers seek to promote the advancement of Gods of the Inner Sea's technology so that the world's inhabitants can better understand\u2014and not fear\u2014the complex mechanisms of so-called artificial life, including androids and free -willed artificial intelligences. Many androids consider themselves the chosen people of Casandalee and depict her as an obvious android with more circuitry or exposed components.",
								"As a young deity, Casandalee has very few followers, the majority of whom live in Numeria. Outside of that country, adherents are usually seen as eccentric outsiders who wield items of advanced technology that seem to work like magic. Traveling priests of Casandalee search for signs of similar equipment that might have been brought from Numeria, in hopes that such discoveries will lead them to beings of artificial life who would benefit from Casandalee's message. In addition, these priests help those who have uncovered or built advanced technology to use it responsibly and understand the science behind it. Many of Casandalee's concerns overlap with those of Brigh, and the two faiths often work together, though the concepts of artificial intelligence can sometimes be hard for followers of Brigh to fully grasp."

								"Chaldira Zuzaristan, the Calamitous Turn, is a plucky, impulsive goddess venerated primarily by halflings. She embodies two aspects halflings see in themselves: a strong affinity for luck and bold determination to protect friends. Chaldira is hotheaded and cannot abide bullies in any form, and many of her worshippers are similarly impetuous, spoiling for any opportunity to leap fist-first at oppressors and tyrants. While many people consider this to be more of a vice than a virtue, Chaldira and her followers feel it is far better to run headlong into trouble than it is to meekly concede to evil out of fear or convenience. Chaldira is also the goddess of light-hearted mischief, insisting that harmless fun, even at others' expense, brings joy and strengthens ties within a community. While not all of Chaldira's followers are inveterate pranksters, most at least know some sleight-of-hand tricks. Chaldira is most often depicted as a halfling woman who matches the appearance of the local halfling community, with curly hair, freckles, and a patchwork red-and-green coat held together by several mismatched buttons.",
								"Chaldira's church is very casual, with few formal priests; most congregations are led by lay priests who pursue a full-time job and work hard to preserve halfling customs, strengthen ties between neighbors, and lift the underprivileged in the community out of poverty. True clerics of Chaldira are responsible for running the church as a whole, as well as petitioning secular leadership for further laws that promote equality. Many Chaldirans support the Bellflower Network, a clandestine organization that labors to free halflings from slavery throughout the Inner Sea region, but principally in Cheliax.",
								"Chaldira is a common companion of Desna, but she considers herself a close friend of nearly all non-evil gods and delights in telling exaggerated tales of their escapades, particularly when such tales involve mischief or embarrassing situations. Even reserved deities such as Erastil or Irori often find themselves pulled into adventures by the irrepressibly friendly goddess\u2014whether they like it or not. Chaldira's chief foe among the gods is Thamir, an evil god venerated by desperate and misanthropic halflings."

								"Ghlaunder is the god of pestilence, infection, and insects. His form resembles that of a giant mosquito, warped and distended by the parasites he hosts. He leaves malaise in his wake, laying waste to everything he can. Ghlaunder revels in suffering, especially that caused by sickness: the last gasp of air into fluid-filled lungs, the terrorizing dreams that come only from the hottest of fevers. It is said that the Gossamer King was once swaddled in a cocoon, but was released by the curious Desna into the world with a cleave of her starknife. Since then, the goddess has pursued him in a macabre dance, hoping to kill him as they flit between planes.",
								"Ghlaunder draws in those cast aside by their fellow kin. His priests are survivors of virulent childhood illnesses that left them changed and embittered, or those who have suffered gruesome tortures or terrible torments at the hands of inexperienced healers and wish to subject others to the same. He attracts misanthropes who wish to spread sickness, drawing from ostracized lepers, those injured and infected in war, and those riddled with pox. Ghlaunder tasks his followers with spreading sickness wherever they go, whether via an illness that they carry themselves or a plague they introduce by other means. Those who speak of him with reverence do so in hushed tones, and their foes include the likes of doctors, midwives, and followers of the goddess Desna.",
								"The adoration of Ghlaunder's acolytes is disturbing to witness. They gather together away from prying eyes and wail to their god, bringing him offerings of rancid meat and fetid bodies, then infesting themselves with leeches and parasites. Ghlaunder's desires are clear: he wants nothing more than to hear cries of anguish in the night when he hovers in the sky, knowing those who suffer below him are rotting from the inside out."

								"Also known as Nana Anadi, Grandmother Spider began her existence as a servant of the other gods, meant to weave fate and reality into existence. Infuriated at her position as a lackey, she made fools of the greater gods through mischief and disruption. She stole and copied Asmodeus' keys, resulting in widespread chaos, and pilfered some of Sarenrae's fire, leading numerous followers astray. Nimbly avoiding any retribution for her antics, Grandmother Spider rewove the strands of fate for herself, gaining her freedom. She regularly pleads with her brother Achaekek to follow her lead and rebel against the gods, and while he always refuses, seemingly indifferent, Achaekek has on one notable occasion proven vengeful toward those who harm his sister or her followers.",
								"Due to the ongoing animosity of Asmodeus, worship of Grandmother Spider is virtually unknown in Avistan. She is traditionally revered in Garund and among anadi, whose ancestors she led through the darkness and into freedom. Temples are rarely dedicated to Grandmother Spider. Her places of worship are instead typically schools and small roadside or home shrines consisting of a spider figurine, a loom, or a woven object. Woven diamond shapes, patterned after Grandmother Spider's religious symbol, can also be found tucked inside the temples of other deities, especially those belonging to the Ascended\u2014those gods who were once mortal.",

								"Ancient beyond mortal reckoning, Groetus is an entity who cannot be easily understood. He hangs in the sky above the Boneyard, a skull-faced moon constantly observing the passage of the souls below. Events can cause him to draw ominously closer to Pharasma's Spire, or to retreat back to a safer distance, with little obvious rhyme or reason for these actions. He evinces little regard for anything but his singular aim: the dissolution of the universe.",
								"While it may seem strange that a deity who seems to actively disregard his worshippers continues to attract faithful followers, Groetus is sought out with morbid fascination by those who desire knowledge of the future. With perfect insight into the final fate of the cosmos, Groetus is able to piece together many of the horrifying possibilities of what is yet to come. For those granted glimpses of such futures, the terrible knowledge is often enough to permanently warp their view of reality. Such unfortunate individuals are often compelled to spread word of the coming triumph of Groetus, warning all those who will listen that the days of the universe are numbered. Groetus is also venerated by those eager for the end of the world, because they either see little value in the current order, find it too painful to cope with reality, or believe the universe is irredeemably flawed and must be destroyed. Many of these followers are more eager for destruction than Groetus himself, who reacts to events that hasten and delay the end times alike with little more than detached acknowledgment. The end is inevitable, and Groetus is patient.",
								"Groetus has no organized church. Most of his clergy are solitary, wandering doomsayers, though some attach themselves to war bands or teams of bandits and encourage such groups to spread chaos. Those who feel themselves guided by the god work to fulfill the conditions of obscure prophecies they feel will quicken the destruction of reality and allow Groetus to close the book of the universe."

								"Gruhastha the Keeper is a deity of understanding, peace, and the collective pursuit of enlightenment. The once-mortal nephew of Irori is believed to have ascended to godhood himself after creating the holy book Azvadeva Pujila, fully embodying all divine wisdom within the text. Originating in Vudra, the Keeper's faith has slowly gained popularity in the Inner Sea region, particularly in Jalmeray, where Irori already has a wide following. Gruhastha manifests as a human man with an idealized form, augmented with wings of red and green plumage and a golden mandala as a halo.",
								"Gruhastha teaches compassion for all beings, and that enlightenment is attained through knowledge guided by wisdom and empathy. His priests and followers are dedicated to educating others, yet recognize that they, too, are constantly learning. They do not hold one culture's teachings as superior to another's and seek to preserve and honor cultural traditions wherever they go, as there are many valid paths to enlightenment.",
								"In seeking knowledge, Gruhasthans work to understand, respect, celebrate, and support everyone on their own personal journeys to transcendence. Temples are open to all and maintain extensive libraries to encourage multilingual literacy; books are often freely given and taken from the Keeper's shrines. Aware that it's difficult to prioritize education or seek transcendence when basic needs are unmet, the Keeper's advocates work to remove structural barriers and ensure everyone has access to the basic comforts and tools they need to guide themselves toward enlightenment.",
								"As Gruhasthans also practice nonviolence\u2014though force is accepted as necessary in some instances\u2014champions of Gruhastha are rare. However, clerics, paladins, redeemers, and all his followers share the same commitment to truth, equity, and justice."

He may be so moved by a fisher's prayer that he blesses her with a catch large enough to feed her village, while later unleashing torrential waves against that same village for a slight. This unpredictability leads the rest of the Heavenly Court to regard him as troublesome, and mortals to view him with wary respect.",

He loves street fairs, festivals, and other raucous celebrations where mortals gather\u2014to the Duke of Thunder, an unpolished street performer on a busy intersection is a more vibrant show than the finest theater could provide.",
								"Hei Feng's church has little formal structure. Hei Fengan priests usually come through in a crisis, but since they tend to be as tempestuous as their deity, their presence can be something of a mixed blessing. Hei Feng is the patron of tengus (and himself takes the form of a tengu with smoking black feathers). His faith is seen mostly in Tian Xia, though his worship has since spread across Gods of the Inner Sea and especially to the Shackles, where sailors and tengu pirates pray for safe voyages between islands."

								"Kazutal, also known as Mother Jaguar or Lady Jaguar, is an old deity, revered for thousands of years on the continent of Arcadia. Ages ago, she was worshipped in the Razatlani Empire as a goddess of might and protection in war. After the catastrophe of Earthfall, however, her edge softened; those who struggled to put the world back together called upon her to protect their neighbors and came together under her guidance to build strong bonds of community and support.",
								"Today Kazutal is worshipped throughout Arcadia as a deity of community, liberty, and safety. Her churches support the downtrodden and reinforce better ways to work alongside one another for compassionate goals. Clerics of Kazutal ask her for strength so they can help those around them and protect them from danger, enriching their communities with civic pride and keeping a sharp eye out for internal dangers and bad actors among their flock. Warpriests of Kazutal rely on the deadly edge of their machetes to fight against corrupting and oppressive forces in the world. Above all, Kazutal's clergy preaches the strength of love, both for other people and the cultures they form, which gives followers the strength to fight without compromise or weakness to protect those they hold dear.",
								"Kazutal is largely unknown in the Inner Sea region. Over the last few years, however, her clerics have ventured to Avistan in response to contact from Chelaxian colonists near the Arcadian city of Segada. Kazutal's teachings of liberty and safety rapidly attracted a number of former slaves after the recent abolitionist success in Absalom, and her emphasis on community brought many of these disparate people together into a political bloc during a crucial time. Other churches of Kazutal are found in Garund, particularly in Senghor and other cities where merchants have traded with Arcadia."

								"Once a mortal farm boy from Taldor who had superhuman strength from youth, Kurgess's selfless sacrifice on the field of competition heralded his rise to godhood. Known as the Strong Man, Kurgess stands as both champion and shining example to those who seek athletic achievement and to give their all in competition, regardless of whether they are victorious or not.",
								"Whether they're priests or lay believers, Kurgessans believe that strength of body and strength of character are the twin pillars that flank the gates of Nirvana, and most train tirelessly to achieve these ideals. Worshippers of Kurgess revel in their strength, eager to show off; this is motivated less by pride, however, than by a desire to inspire others to strive for their own potential. While the teachings of Kurgess emphasize physicality, wizards and other students of magic occasionally find inspiration in the Strong Man's example, delving into the study of magic with the same zeal more traditional worshippers apply to physical exercises. Some spellcasters believe that keeping one's body in good shape helps keep one's mind just as sharp, and they actively seek to bolster their physical prowess as part of their path toward developing their mental acuity and endurance. Regardless of their methods, Kurgessans are commonly jovial and encouraging, even to their rivals, and their companions often cannot help but be inspired by their enthusiasm.",
								"While Kurgessans are willing to demonstrate their strength in combat, especially to protect others or defend their ideals, followers of the Strong Man take no pleasure in mortal combat or the deaths of even the direst of enemies. By and large a light-hearted lot, Kurgessans prefer training, games, and friendly competition to war and bloody conflict. When the need arises, however, Kurgessans can be found on the front lines of combat, and heroic orders such as the Knights of Lastwall often count Kurgessan champions among their ranks."

As a subtle tell to other Milanites of the structure's true intent, these buildings usually feature a small rose garden or other rose iconography. One of the most famous and oldest of these safe havens is an inn in Absalom known as the Sanguine Thorn, which served as a staging point for hundreds of successful liberation attempts in the area. While most believe the tavern was destroyed in the earthquake that devastated Absalom's Precipice District, rumors circulate about a traveling wagon caravan that secretly uses the tavern's name to refer to the collective of Milanites who travel with it, moving from place to place undermining persecution in all its forms and fighting for freedom at all costs."

								"Goddess of gems, stealth, and gambling, Nivi Rhombodazzle is the ultimate high roller, said to have won her divinity from the dwarven god Torag in exchange for a gemstone. She was once a mortal gnome who loved the thrill of an exciting wager, up to and including the moment when the dice turned against her. Eventually, Nivi's debts grew too great for her to remain in her surface home, and she fled into the depths of the Darklands to evade the wrath of her creditors. Most of her adventures in the lightless lands are lost to time and history, but she ultimately emerged reborn as a goddess, hailed as the first of the svirfneblin\u2014uncanny underground gnomes with unique magical abilities and immunity to the dread Bleaching, a wasting curse that claims the lives of gnomes who succumb to boredom and ennui.",
								"Nivi's church appeals most strongly to the svirfneblin of the Darklands, but many gnomes who live upon the surface believe the goddess's tenets can protect them from the wasting effects of the Bleaching. Nivi is not exclusively a gnome deity, however, and she welcomes the worship of any risk-taker who is willing to roll the dice and let them fall where they may. Once Nivi's worship is established in an area, it often spreads quite quickly, particularly amongst gnomes. While it's unclear whether or not Nivi actually has any direct ability to protect gnomes who worship her from the Bleaching, her faith's encouragement of gambling and risky behaviors serves as a potent inoculation against boredom and ennui. Even those not subject to the Bleaching often find Nivi's faith to be entertaining, at the very least.",
								"Nivi's temples tend to serve dual roles, acting both as places of worship and shelters in times of dangers. Such temples always have secret tunnels, hidden rooms, or other escape routes to ensure that there is always a safe exit from the temple in case its inhabitants become trapped within. Most of her temples and shrines are built into inconspicuous locales, such as basements of shops and gambling halls\u2014the latter are particularly common gathering sites for her faithful."

								"For most of her existence, Nocticula was a patron of assassins and succubi, a demon lord feared by other demon lords for her skill at assassinating the competition. Those days are behind Nocticula, for she has risen to the role of the Redeemer Queen, a patron of marginalized artists and protector of those cast out from society. She is now feared among her former peers for her persuasive words that tempt them away from their place in the Abyss and toward redemption. Her faith is strongest in the eastern reaches of New Thassilon, where her most powerful exile, Queen Sorshen, seeks to build a nation that welcomes those whom others have cast out.",
								"Nocticula dwells in a remote archipelago known as Midnight's Palette. She encourages her worshippers to welcome pilgrims, refugees, and strangers; those who seek to abuse these open borders are counted as the greatest enemies of the church. Nocticula teaches forgiveness and encourages her followers to give their foes opportunities to repent, but rescind mercy from those who take advantage.",
								"Creating art\u2014whether it's sculpture or painting, song or story, public performance or private display\u2014is important to the faith, but just as important is the protection of art and the artists who create. Nocticula teaches that the most important art is that which challenges you, compels you to look at the world in a different way, or threatens your comfort, for it is through the change enabled by such art that one can grow."

								"No ancient record reveals the truth of Sivanah's origins; in fact, only recent documents record her existence at all. The Seventh Veil is widely regarded as the goddess of illusion magic, often portrayed as a figure disguised by seven veils. Legends state that each face underneath the first six of her seven veils is of a different ancestry\u2014human, elf, halfling, gnome, anadi, and naga\u2014but the seventh face is never shown, believed to mask the goddess's true form. Some theologians believe Sivanah hails from the Shadow Plane, though the goddess's true nature and form continue to be topics of debate. Even her female visage, while agreed upon by her followers, could likewise be an illusion. Her goals are hidden from even her most faithful, which some believe to have hampered the faith's growth and influence beyond the level of a cult.",
								"Sivanah is well loved by gnomes, who believe the goddess embodies a playful dance between illusion and reality. Gnomes who are drawn to magic and illusions are especially likely to pay their respects to Sivanah, and some wear knotted scarves to honor the goddess of illusions. Anadis are also sometimes drawn to Sivanah, though there is some contention among religious scholars over whether Sivanah's fifth veil truly obscures an anadi or some other being known for its mastery of illusion, as older legends claim the fifth veil concealed a cyclops. Outside of gnomes and anadi, Sivanah draws those who benefit from hiding their appearance or intentions, whether they're illusionists or thieves, or simply wish to live and present a different lifestyle than the one they currently have.",
								"The Seventh Veil safeguards those who plead for secrecy, especially those in disguise for their safety. As the goddess of reflections, Sivanah employs mirrors, reflections in water, and even sometimes shadows to connect with her most faithful. She has a rivalry with Zon-Kuthon, loathing the dark god's corruption of shadows, and she sometimes uses her influence to cause darkness to act unexpectedly for the Midnight Lord's clerics."

								"The Empress of Heaven is worshipped across all of Tian Xia by people of all walks of life, from commoner to lord, farmer to samurai, human to dragon. She is revered as the ruler of the Tian pantheon, respected as the finest samurai in Heaven or Gods of the Inner Sea, and honored as the patron of nature and emperors alike. Perhaps the most famous tale about her is that of Shizuru and her lover Tsukiyo, the moon god. After Tsukiyo was slain by his brother Fumeiyoshi in a fit of jealousy, Shizuru brought the moon god back to life with the aid of Qi Zhong, the god of medicine. Sadly, Tsukiyo was deeply affected by his experience with death, and though he and Shizuru still love each other, the event created a rift between them. Even so, on the days of an eclipse, they embrace as one.",
								"Followers of Shizuru lead structured lives. Their dedication to duty is nigh absolute, both to fulfill their responsibilities to earth and Heaven and to distract from the personal sorrows they often share with their goddess. To better dedicate themselves to their cause, many Shizurans are emotionally reserved, preferring to lead lives distant from others. Even so, many of Shizuru's priests earn the respect of the communities in or near which they reside, with locals calling upon these priests to aid in times of danger. Her most devout worshippers take up swordplay as both a practical tool of battle and a means to hone the mind and body. Many liken this to the practices of Iomedae's clergy, even going so far as treat the two deities as sister goddesses, though Shizuru's faithful prefer diplomacy to battle and pray for peaceful days instead of glorious war. All the same, followers of Shizuru consider themselves allies of Iomedae, as the Empress of Heaven holds a half-concealed fondness for the younger and more idealistic goddess.",
								"Though Shizuru is mainly worshipped in Tian Xia, especially in the nation of Minkai and other Tian-Min nations, Tian immigrants to Brevoy, Mendev, and Varisia have brought their worship with them. These immigrants often treat their faith as a connection to their homelands, paying homage to the Empress of Heaven as a way of honoring their ancestors and heritage."

He now sees the world differently from most\u2014something that has strained his relationships and made it difficult for him to relate to others, but has also allowed him to offer his understanding and quiet comfort to those who are lost, demonized, or misunderstood.",

Though his church primarily operates in Tian Xia, followers of Tsukiyo tend to be wanderers by nature and can be found anywhere in the world. In particular, Tian immigrants established a strong following in Ustalav and Varisia. Members of Tsukiyo's clergy tend to take up the role of wandering counselors, offering wisdom, guidance, and therapy to those in need wherever they go, and they are welcomed in almost any community for their services. When engaging with those with mental illness or disability, priests of Tsukiyo prefer to offer assistance by teaching communities to respect and celebrate these individuals. Tsukiyan priests never attempt to treat these individuals unless they desire such assistance."
