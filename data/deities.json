								"Asmodeus is the First, the Dark Prince, the lord of darkness and law, and the ruler of the plane of Hell. If Asmodeus’s own scriptures are to believed—and they are corroborated by certain other accounts, like the angel-penned Book of the Damned—he is one of the oldest beings of the multiverse. These texts claim that in time before time, in a world not yet created, Asmodeus and his brother Ihys were among the first gods in existence. During these unnamed ages, the two gods quarreled over the fate of the souls of their creations, and Asmodeus slew his brother. Confident that Ihys’s act of granting mortals free will was folly, Asmodeus made his own convictions known: that existence is best served by absolute order and discipline. These claims contradict other popular creation myths, and both theologians and immortal agents of the gods doubt Asmodeus’s claims to varying degrees, but while there is no evidence to prove them, they are also difficult to refute.",
								"Asmodeus can take any form he wishes. His best-known depiction, however, is the appearance he is given in popular art: an ancient being with striking red skin and black horns and hooves, surrounded with a pale aura of flames. He is shown either bearing a long contract scroll and a vicious -looking flaming mace, or seated upon a throne ruling over hordes of devils above the apocalyptic landscape of Hell. Asmodeus is known to be eloquent, tactful, patient, and incredibly brilliant, but when angered, he is wrathful and terrifying.",
								"Despite his fiendish depiction and the widespread knowledge of his disdain for free will, many mortals worship Asmodeus. Setting aside the question of good and evil (he most certainly is evil), Asmodeus is an immensely powerful divine being—perhaps one of the most powerful in existence. He represents strict discipline, as he was a being of order long before the concepts of right and wrong were created. This representation of Asmodeus as a champion of law means that his worship is not limited to cults and hushed whispers.",
								"Even though it is heavily frowned upon in most areas of the world, his worship is nevertheless widespread and occasionally, in cases like the nation of Cheliax, the primary religion of a region.",
								"Servitors of Asmodeus include power-hungry priests, diabolists, lawyers, and the decadent nobility of Hell-bound regions like Cheliax. These followers find the inherent structure of Hell a virtue and even seek to emulate it through clever use of the law. Making use of such order allows followers to vie for higher positions of power, usually by taking advantage of complicated bureaucracies. This is a skill that most Asmodeans share, as the church’s holy text, the Asmodean Monograph, is itself a tome with several supplemental volumes and appendices that together require a deep understanding to even navigate, much less exploit. Asmodeans are careful in their pursuit of power, however, as a quick ascension or an overextension can leave one vulnerable to those intent on finding weakness.",
								"Beyond his clerics and priests, Asmodeus has hold over several other types of worshippers. Soldiers and other martially minded individuals might welcome Asmodeus’s gifts and the dogma of force and dominance required to wield them, but regardless of their role, anyone seeking great power or wealth likely finds themself facing the Dark Prince’s temptations. These might take the form of a local Asmodean priest offering such gifts through questionable yet technically legal means. Other times, devils appear to offer literal infernal contracts accepting the signer’s soul in exchange for greater abilities, such as spellcasting or the ability to summon that devil.",
								"Temples of Asmodeus vary greatly from region to region, depending on the faith’s reception. Public temples to the Dark Prince typically feature gothic or baroque architecture. In Cheliax, his temples sometimes double as government buildings or share space with such structures. Inside, bureaucrats, judges, and other government workers use their understanding of contracts and laws to maintain the infernal machine of order. In places less open to worship of Asmodeus, his temples may be secret sites, such as hidden shrines in personal homes or concealed temples accessible only via secret doors and halls."

Aristocrats, city guards, merchants, and those working in legal practice or who have the well-being of their community on their mind are common worshippers of the god of cities, along with dwarves in general. Abadaran priests living in cities often serve as judges, lawyers, and clerks, while those who live on the frontier work as roving magistrates, acting as judge, jury, and executioners in the name of order.",
								"Abadar is the keeper of the First Vault, a divine trove that holds the perfect version of every type of creature and object. The Vault is home to the perfect longsword, the perfect shield, the perfect songbird, the perfect hammer, and even a perfect law. His followers do their best to emulate these perfect forms in their own way, whether through crafting a work of art, raising strong and healthy livestock, or passing laws that best serve the people in a community.",
								"The holy book of Abadar’s worshippers, {@i The Order of Numbers}, commands his followers to build cities and settlements where there are none, to work hard and trade in pursuit of wealth, and to follow the law while doing so. If a profession is a lawful part of society, it is ordained by Abadar. As such, those who work at the behest of government often pay homage to Abadar, as do others who directly benefit from the rule of law and trade. Naturally, those who oppose the law or actively work against it—such as thieves, criminals, bandits, and pirates—are enemies of the church and society as Abadar sees it. Despite this, some heretical factions of Abadar’s worshippers twist the words of {@i The Order of Numbers} for their own purposes to pursue wealth over all. They justify their criminal behavior with the holy words of order and wealth while subverting the rule of law on technicalities, undermining law-abiding institutions.",
								"As the god of cities and laws, Abadar is a stern but just master. He rewards those who work hard and looks down on those who would cheat the system for their own gains. Abadar understands that not everyone gets a fair deal in the world of mortals, but he encourages his clergy to support laws that are as equitable as possible, enabling those of lower status to rise. The church frowns on slavery, believing that trade should always be fair and that no price offered can ever compensate the entirety of a creature’s life and labor.",
								"Clerics of Abadar labor to help their communities grow and flourish. They seek to aid in the passage of effective laws and encourage bringing order to places where it is absent. When ministering to their congregants, clerics wear robes of white silk with accents of gold that show the wealth of their church. Temples dedicated to Abadar are fortified, as they often serve double duty as banks, moneylenders, and currency exchanges. Despite this practical purpose, these temples tend to be highly decorated, commonly featuring elegant architecture adorned with gold and stained-glass windows.",
								"The church of Abadar in Avistan feels it must charge for its divine services in tribute to the god of merchants, but his servants seek to handle matters of public health and safety quickly, and without requiring payment. Priests are also encouraged to strike out on business ventures as a holy duty to enrich the church. These holy ventures often put members of an individual church and those of neighboring churches in competition. Such competition is seen as healthy and often encouraged; however, church law forbids clergy from harming one another, including during warfare on behalf of opposed nations or kingdoms. As a result, Abadarans often act as a neutral negotiators between warring nations—for a fee, of course.",
								"Through {@i The Order of Numbers}, Abadar teaches his clergy that following the law leads to wealth and comfort, and thus happiness. He teaches that discipline leads to keen judgment, which in turn leads to favorable deals, whether they relate to commerce, law, or other types of negotiations. While Abadar encourages the expansion of ordered society, he rejects hasty action and advises caution in all things. Abadaran clergy pass these tenets on to their congregations, teaching the layfolk about trade and commerce as a system for happiness. These teachings also impart the ideals of fairness and following the spirit of the law, while still respecting the letter thereof. One of the church’s most important lessons is the value of cooperation between citizens, as community is paramount to the health of a town and kingdom. However, they also recognize that self-interest is most individuals’ strongest motivation to increase their own standing and wealth."

								"As symbolized by the three daggers of her religious symbol, Calistria has three aspects: lust, revenge, and trickery. Silver-tongued and charming, she is a master of weaving insults into compliments and laying intricate groundwork for retribution at its finest. She is a goddess of vengeance, but it would be a mistake to assume that means she pursues justice. Calistria is fickle, shifting her loyalties and interests as her whims take her—though she never forgets a slight, and any who think she has forgiven will surely find it is only a matter of time before they are targeted by a long-term plot of revenge to lay them thoroughly low.",
								"Though she is one of several elven deities, Calistria is by far the best known outside of elven communities, and thus many non-elves view her as the representative (or even the only) elven goddess. This conclusion is not entirely unreasonable, as Calistria represents those aspects of the elven ancestry that many other people see as alluring, intriguing, and fascinating. Among elves, she embodies characteristics endemic to elven culture and identity, such as free-spirited pursuit of one’s own path, and further embodies a truth lost on shorter-lived peoples: the flexibility and capriciousness of Calistria provides a model for maintaining perspective and composure over a centuries-long lifespan. As a result, she is closely associated with the elven people by elves and others alike. Of the elven deities, she receives by far the most worship from non-elves.",
								"As the goddess’s whims are ever-shifting, her worshippers are also often somewhat transient. Even among elves, worship of Calistria is usually intermittent or secondary to faith in another deity. Prayers to Calistria arise from individuals who find themselves driven by lust, engaged in trickery, or driven to revenge, and the people offering those prayers may have no commitment to the faith beyond the prayer offered in that moment. As followers’ lives lead them in different directions, they move on to other deities, just as the goddess herself moves from one lover to the next to suit her shifting interests. This personal freedom is a value held dear by the goddess and her followers alike, and perhaps one of the most central values to elven society as a whole. Some of Calistria’s most devoted followers work to promote this tenet, quietly working to undermine tyrannical governments, exacting revenge upon slavers and freeing their captives, or simply demonstrating the benefits of a freedom-driven lifestyle.",

								"Organized worship of Calistria is most common among elves, as befits an elven deity. Though rumor would suggest all her temples are brothels, these gathering spaces are often more akin to intellectual salons—albeit more encouraging and supportive of sexual interaction between attendees than most equivalent secular institutions. Others function more akin to a thieves’ guild, providing a place to sow and reap rumors, plot acts of questionable legality, and perhaps also engage in lust-driven interactions—all activities suitable to take place behind closed doors.",
								"Clerics of the goddess endeavor to hold the three aspects of their goddess in balance, as a lifetime in service to any one can easily become monotonous, and Calistria abhors her followers becoming overly consumed by a single pursuit. Champions are sometimes more focused, such as those who dedicate themselves to fighting slavery, but even these are careful to avoid becoming so wrapped up in their work that they lose sight of the other aspects of life that make it worth living.",
								"Special rituals, conducted as needed, include invocations of the goddess’s blessing when a worshipper begins pursuit of a desired lover, divinations to determine her approval or disapproval of set courses of revenge, initiation rites for those who wish to devote themselves to the faith, and birth and death ceremonies. But Calistria’s faith places little stock in marriage; between the goddess’s own shifting interests and the mercurial nature of relationships between long-lived elves, marriage is much less of an institution as it is among other peoples.",
								"Wasps are iconic to Calistria, as widely recognized as a symbol of the faith as her formal religious symbol. Like the goddess, a wasp inflicts extreme pain in retribution for an offense, far beyond what it seems a simple insect ought to be capable of. Further cementing the similarity is the fact that the wasp seems to take a perverse pleasure in its attacks, pursuing offenders and stinging repeatedly. Many followers of Calistria carry yellow-and-black tokens on their person as a form of homage. Priests are known to cultivate giant wasp allies and pets, and many Calistrian gathering places harbor swarms of wasps under the eaves or in similarly sheltered spots. These swarms tend to ignore worshippers but descend in force upon any interlopers, defending such locations with even greater spite than expected from a typical wasp."

								"Once a mortal human, Cayden Cailean is now one the few deities known as the Ascended. In his mortal years, Cayden was a sellsword of no small fame, known for his boisterous manner, skill with a blade, and fearless resolve. During a particularly rowdy night of drinking, a series of escalating dares led the wandering mercenary to attempt the Test of the Starstone. He emerged from the Starstone Cathedral 3 days later, laughing, a fully realized god. Divine responsibility did little to change Cayden’s attitude from what it was in his mortal life. He continues to crave adventure, drink, and pleasurable company while abhorring bullies, tyrants, and cowards.",
								"Cayden has no formal churches or structured clergy, but simple shrines to him appear in almost every tavern and roadside inn. Many of his priests own such businesses and offer healing to patrons, some of whom may have been injured during a drunken brawl. While Cayden’s faith is a charitable one, Caydenites still seek payment for such services—at the very least, the injured party is expected to purchase a round of drinks for the house. Only in places where worshippers of the Accidental God are in direct opposition to the local powers, such as where a rebellion is forming under a tyrant’s nose, is his church out of the public eye. Caydenites can bring themselves to be quiet in the face of oppression only for so long, however, and once a rebellion reaches full bloom, the god’s silver tankard is often proudly displayed across every bar.",
								"As a mortal, Cayden often found himself at odds with the work he was hired to perform and abandoned jobs that went against his conscience. This gave him a reputation for being unreliable among his more unscrupulous employers, but it garnered significant respect from clients with stronger morals. Legends tell of him taking contracts to free entire crews of slaves, undoing the operations of predatory business owners, and other rebellious deeds for the good of the common folk. His worshippers often involve themselves in similar matters: safeguarding the freedom and prosperity of working-class people, overthrowing tyrants, and helping the oppressed relocate to freer lands. His champions, in particular, embed themselves in nations with harsh laws and stir up rebellions—often from the back room of a tavern.",
								"Members of Cayden’s faith also maintain many orphanages in urban areas, arranging them to receive funding from local pubs and other Cayden-friendly establishments. Not much is known about Cayden’s childhood as a mortal, but given his patronage of such houses, many have inferred that he spent at least some time in an orphanage when he was young. While the children in such orphanages are not expressly raised in the faith, most adopt the god’s teachings when they grow old enough to leave. These individuals often take the surname Cailean to honor him, adding to the number of gregarious rebels in the world.",
								"While the consumption of alcohol is central to most of Cayden’s worship, drinking to excess and dependency on drink are seen as misuse of the Accidental God’s gifts. Clergy who develop such an addiction are encouraged by their community to take a large role in the faith’s other works, such as maintaining orphanages or supporting rebel efforts, and those who recover often work to assist others with their own recovery from alcoholism. Though being the god of alcohol is a popular aspect of Cayden Cailean, members of his faith often find personal freedom and rejection of tyranny just as appealing as a strong drink, and it is not uncommon for teetotalers to number among Cayden’s followers.",
								"Cayden is not particular about who worships him, so long as they abide by the simple expectations of freedom, bravery, and enjoying a good drink. As such, he has followers from almost all ancestries. A good number of his worshippers are half-orcs, who find the casual tenets and welcoming nature of the faith to be a good fit for those who have been ostracized from more stringent communities. His followers are typically good natured, boisterous, and optimistic. Life simply holds too much to take in for anyone to spend it gloomy. Many adventurers find Cayden’s tenets to be a natural fit, taking jobs when they can and bucking cruelty wherever they find it."

								"The night didn’t know beauty until Desna came into existence. While the other gods toiled away to create the world, she set her sights on the heavens, placing each star in the sky. After surveying her artistry, she hung the brightest star high in the north and made it her home. Her first gift to mortals was this beacon of hope, a twinkling sign in the dark sky that they could turn to when lost or unsure of themselves. Desna provides safe passage through the darkness to all, should they choose to follow.",
								"Desna journeys without end, for the wonders of the universe are endless. She relies on instinct to guide her, paying no mind to planning or destination. Her lapsing attention may come off as uncaring or cold, but Desna simply prefers an untethered, carefree existence. Her confidence in herself and her followers frees her from the indulgence of worry. She knows fate can always be rewritten and encourages others to embrace all that life has to offer. Desna wants her followers to take chances, get messy, and live life to its fullest. Those who follow her teachings she rewards with a spot of luck—revealing unseen shortcuts, dangers to be circumvented, and undiscovered wonders.",
								"Desna is an ancient being, born during the dawn of time, but her sense of wonder has never faded. Even so, she is no stranger to hardship, understanding that fate can be cruel and love can be lost. This only strengthens her resolve. She believes in good luck, and that people can make their own fortune in life. To Desna, no one is ever truly lost; they need only find their way back to the path. She revels in mystery, being herself somewhat of an enigma, but she can always be found on the side of hope. Light always pierces the darkness, and all nightmares eventually give way to dreams.",
								"The goddess loves music and live performances. Legends say Desna played the world’s first song by ringing the stars to celebrate the gods’ completion of the material world. Her faithful have embraced her love of music and the arts and are often performers themselves, with many modern songs and dances having their roots in Desnan worship. Artists devoted to Desna have created some of the most famous poems and ballads on Golarion and often perform in conjunction with Shelynites. A sizable portion of Desna’s priesthood are bards, spreading her songs across the world on their travels.",
								"Desna encourages her followers to chase their bliss, find what impassions them, and explore. She recognizes love in all its forms and remains committed to her lovers Sarenrae and Shelyn. She also shares a close relationship with Cayden Cailean and has no reservations about taking on new lovers. Desna is protective of those she cares for and does not hesitate to strike back at any who would hurt or impede those she has placed under her protection.",
								"When making a rare appearance to mortals, Desna appears as a beautiful woman with long dark hair and shining stars in her eyes. Brilliant, colorful patterns of pinks, purples, and blues trail behind her like a comet’s tail as her majestic butterfly wings fly her through the cosmos. If she wishes to make her desires known, she imparts wondrous dreams to her followers, allowing them the rare opportunity to dance among the stars with her.",
								"There is little sense of authority within the Desnan church, though on Golarion it is a faith that dates as far back as ancient Azlant. The church lacks any sort of hierarchy, and priests are valued by the tales of the journeys they’ve undertaken and the experiences they’ve had rather than for any seniority. A typical Desnan service is performed almost entirely in song, with interludes of dance, storytelling, and dream recollection interspersed throughout.",
								"Most centers of worship for Desna are not ornate temples but instead small, unattended shrines. These shrines are most commonly found at crossroads, remote areas of beauty, or the tops of hills where the stars can be viewed unimpeded. Traveling Desnan priests clean and maintain these shrines as they encounter them, leaving their signatures behind as a way of marking their own journey."
