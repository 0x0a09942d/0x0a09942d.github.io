If the wall would pass through a creature, the spell is lost. The wall sheds bright light for 20 feet on each side, and dim light for the next 20 feet. You can ignore the wall’s effects. Roll 1d4 to determine the color of the wall. Each color has a particular effect on items, effects, or creatures that attempt to pass through. Chromatic wall can’t be counteracted normally; rather, each color is automatically counteracted when targeted by a specific spell, even if that spell’s level is lower than that of chromatic wall. 1. Red The wall destroys ranged weapon ammunition (such as arrows and crossbow bolts) that would pass through, and it deals 20 fire damage to anyone passing through, with a basic Reflex save. Cone of cold can counteract a red chromatic wall. 2. Orange The wall destroys thrown weapons that would pass through, and it deals 25 acid damage to anyone passing through, with a basic Reflex save. Gust of wind can counteract an orange chromatic wall. 3. Yellow The wall stops acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, negative, positive, and sonic effects from passing through, and it deals 30 electricity damage to anyone passing through, with a basic Reflex save. Disintegrate can counteract a yellow chromatic wall. 4. Green The wall stops toxins, gases, and breath weapons from passing through. It deals 10 poison damage to anyone passing through and makes them enfeebled 1 for 1 minute. A basic Fortitude save reduces the damage and negates the enfeebled condition on a success. Passwall can counteract a green chromatic wall. MAGIC AND MORALITY While magic allows you to perform wondrous acts in the game, it can be used for terrible purposes. While some spells are obviously vile or have the evil trait and a direct connection to the profane, other spells can be used for good or ill. Using magic does not free you from the morality of the outcome. Nowhere is this more true than when it comes to enchantment spells, especially those used to compel a character to do something. These spells can remove the power of choice from a character and can very easily be used in ways that are evil. Dominating an ogre and forcing him to abandon his guard post is not necessarily evil, but using that same spell to force a merchant to give you all of his wares certainly is. Using a spell for an evil purpose can cause a player character’s alignment to shift to evil, with the ultimate judgment of whether a player is using a spell for an evil purpose left up to the GM. Regardless of in-game effects, all players should take care when using such spells. These effects can negatively affect people at the table, as they might create situations that echo truly awful experiences players might have had, creating uncomfortable or hostile environments. Players and GMs should work to prevent these situations so everyone can focus on having fun at the table.",

Magic missile can counteract a blue chromatic wall. 6. Indigo The wall stops divination and mental effects from passing through, and those passing through are subject to the effects of warp mind. Searing light can counteract an indigo chromatic wall. 7. Violet The wall prevents spells from targeting the other side (area effects still cross as normal). Creatures passing through must succeed at a Will save or they are slowed 1 for 1 minute; on a critical failure, the creature is instead sent to another plane, with the effect of plane shift.

For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. The GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion.

Targets gain 5 temporary Hit Points, a +10-foot status\nbonus to their Speeds, and weakness 5 to silver. They also\ngrow vicious fangs and claws, which are unarmed attacks. The\nfangs deal 2d8 piercing damage; the claws deal 2d6 slashing\ndamage and have the agile and finesse traits. The targets\nuse their highest weapon or unarmed attack proficiency\nwith these attacks, and if they have weapon specialization\nor greater weapon specialization, they add this damage as\nwell. On a critical hit with one of these unarmed attacks, the\ncreature struck takes 1d4 persistent bleed damage.\nThe targets can’t use concentrate actions unless those\nactions also have the rage trait, with the exception of Seek. A\ncreature can attempt to end the spell’s effect on itself by using\na single action, which has the rage trait, to attempt a Will save\nagainst your spell DC; on a success, it ends the spell’s effect\non itself.\nIf a target is in the light of a full moon, it also grows by one\nsize if it were Medium or smaller. This increases the reach of a\nMedium or Tiny creature by 5 feet."

The target instinctively knows which creature this is. At the end of each of the target’s turns, if the target did not use a hostile action against the creature you chose during that turn, the weapon Strikes the target. If you name “peace,” mentally choose up to five allies. The target instinctively knows who those allies are. The weapon Strikes the target each time the target uses a hostile action against you or one of your allies. The weapon Strikes only once per action, even if the action targets multiple allies (such as for a fireball or a Whirlwind Strike). Strikes with the weapon are melee weapon attacks, but they use your spell attack modifier. Regardless of its appearance, the weapon deals force damage equal to 3d10 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. The weapon takes a multiple attack penalty, which increases throughout the target’s turn, but its penalty is separate from yours. When the weapon Strikes, you can deal damage of the normal damage type of the weapon instead of force damage (or any of the available damage types, for a versatile weapon). No other statistics or attributes of the weapon apply, and even a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only. A weapon of judgment is a weapon for the purposes of triggers, resistances, and so forth. The weapon doesn’t take up space, grant flanking, or have any other attributes a creature would.

The target\ninstinctively knows which creature this is. At the end of each\nof the target’s turns, if the target did not use a hostile action\nagainst the creature you chose during that turn, the weapon\nStrikes the target.\nIf you name “peace,” mentally choose up to five allies. The\ntarget instinctively knows who those allies are. The weapon\nStrikes the target each time the target uses a hostile action\nagainst you or one of your allies. The weapon Strikes only\nonce per action, even if the action targets multiple allies (such\nas for a fireball or a Whirlwind Strike).\nStrikes with the weapon are melee weapon attacks, but they\nuse your spell attack modifier. Regardless of its appearance,\nthe weapon deals force damage equal to 3d10 plus your\nspellcasting ability modifier. The weapon takes a multiple\nattack penalty, which increases throughout the target’s turn,\nbut its penalty is separate from yours.\nWhen the weapon Strikes, you can deal damage of the\nnormal damage type of the weapon instead of force damage\n(or any of the available damage types, for a versatile weapon).\nNo other statistics or attributes of the weapon apply, and even\na ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only. A weapon of\njudgment is a weapon for the purposes of triggers, resistances,\nand so forth.\nThe weapon doesn’t take up space, grant flanking, or have\nany other attributes a creature would. The weapon can’t make\nany attack other than its Strike, and feats or spells that affect\nweapons do not apply to this weapon."
