Blessed One Through luck or deed, heritage or heroics, you carry the blessing of a deity. This blessing manifests as the ability to heal wounds and remove harmful conditions, and exists independent of worship. You might offer thanks daily to the deity whose power you wield, or you might carry these blessings reluctantly, seeking to avoid responsibility or even acting to defy the deity's influence on you. You might wear the robes of the deity's order, or you might give little thought and even less reverence to the source of your powers. However you feel about these gifts, there can be no doubt that you wield a special power. Good-aligned deities are most likely to empower a blessed one. However, deities of any alignment can grant such a blessing, as long as they are capable of granting a positive divine font to their clerics. This means such deities as Lamashtu might grant a foul version of the blessed one's powers. Additional Feats: 6th Accelerating Touch (page 119), Mercy (Core Rulebook 111); 8th Invigorating Mercy (page 119); 10th Greater Mercy (Core Rulebook 112); 12th Elucidating Mercy (page 120), Resilient Touch (page 120); 14th Affliction Mercy (Core Rulebook 113), Amplifying Touch (page 120); 20th Rejuvenating Touch (page 121) BLESSED ONE DEDICATION FEAT 2 ARCHETYPE DEDICATION You are touched by a deity and gifted with the ability to alleviate the suffering of others. You gain the {@spell lay on hands} devotion spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. This feat grants a focus pool of 1 Focus Point that you can recover using the {@action Refocus} activity (Core Rulebook 300). You can {@action Refocus} by meditating, whether you reflect on the deity granting the blessing or not, allowing your blessing to refill your focus pool. Your devotion spells from the blessed one archetype are divine spells. Special You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the blessed one archetype. BLESSED SACRIFICE FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Blessed One Dedication You gain the protector's sacrifice domain spell as a devotion spell. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. BLESSED SPELL {@as 1} FEAT 8 ARCHETYPE CONCENTRATE METAMAGIC Prerequisites Blessed One Dedication, ability to cast spells from spell slots, Mercy Frequency once per 10 minutes When you focus your magic on an ally, you can remove harmful conditions. If your next action is to {@action Cast a Spell} from a spell slot, and that spell targets only a single ally, you can also attempt to remove a harmful condition from that ally. The condition must be one that could be removed by your Mercy feat, including those granted by later feats such as Greater Mercy. Attempt a counteract check based on the spell's DC and level. This effect is in addition to the normal effects of your spell. BLESSED DENIAL {@as R} FEAT 12 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Blessed One Dedication Trigger An ally within 30 feet would become {@condition frightened}, {@condition drained}, {@condition enfeebled}, {@condition sickened}, or {@condition stupefied}. You exude peace and protection, lessening a harmful condition as it falls upon an ally. Reduce the value of the condition your ally would take by 1 (to a minimum of 0). If the ally takes more than one condition at the same time, choose one to reduce. Bounty Hunter Whether for coin, glory, or justice, you know how to track, defeat, and capture dangerous individuals. You're accustomed to perusing wanted posters, searching up on leads, and pursuing villains to hell and back. Additional Feats: 14th Double Prey (Core Rulebook 175) BOUNTY HUNTER DEDICATION FEAT 2 ARCHETYPE DEDICATION Prerequisites trained in {@skill Survival} When focused on finding your quarry, you're relentless. You gain the Hunt Prey action (Core Rulebook 168).

In addition to the other benefits of Hunt Prey, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to {@action Gather Information} regarding your prey. If you already have Hunt Prey, you become an expert in {@skill Survival} and gain the circumstance bonus to {@action Gather Information} about your prey; you can still designate a creature you're tracking during exploration, in addition to the conditions above. Special You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the bounty hunter archetype. TOOLS OF THE TRADE FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE You're well-versed in weapons that allow you to bring bounties in alive. You are trained with the following weapons: bola (page 248), sap, and whip. You gain access to bolas. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency in the weapons listed. In addition, you take no penalty when making a nonlethal attack with a weapon without the {@trait nonlethal} trait.

By spending 1 minute giving guidance to help hunt down your prey, you instruct up to five willing creatures to assist you. They gain a +1 circumstance bonus to {@action Seek} your prey, to {@action Track} your prey, and to {@action Gather Information} about your prey. You and the creatures assisting you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to initiative rolls when entering combat with your prey. This benefit lasts until you designate a new prey or your prey dies, whichever comes first. An individual creature assisting you loses this benefit if they're out of your presence for too long to benefit from your instructions. This is usually 1 hour, but is determined by the GM. KEEP PACE {@as R} FEAT 6 ARCHETYPE Trigger Your prey is within reach and attempts to move away from you. Your prey can't {@action Escape}. {@action Stride} up to your Speed, following the foe and keeping it in reach throughout its movement until it stops moving or you've moved your full Speed. You can use Keep Pace to {@action Burrow}, {@action Climb}, {@action Fly}, or {@action Swim} instead of {@action Stride} if you have the corresponding movement type. OPPORTUNISTIC GRAPPLE {@as R} FEAT 8 ARCHETYPE Requirements Your prey is within your reach, you have at least one free hand, and your target is no more than one size larger than you. Trigger Your prey critically fails on a melee {@action Strike}'s attack roll against you. You attempt an {@skill Athletics} check to {@action Grapple} your prey. Dedication feat becomes a mature animal companion, granting it additional capabilities. During an encounter, even if you don't use the {@action Command an Animal} action, your animal companion can still use 1 action on your turn to {@action Stride} or {@action Strike}. QUICK MOUNT {@as 1} FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE SKILL Prerequisites Cavalier Dedication, expert in {@skill Nature} Requirements You are adjacent to a creature that is at least one size larger than you and is willing to be your mount. You and your mount can spring into action at a moment's notice. You {@action Mount} the creature and {@action Command an Animal} to issue it an order of your choice. DEFEND MOUNT {@as R} FEAT 6 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Cavalier Dedication Trigger An enemy makes an attack roll against your mount while you're riding it. You interpose yourself between an attacker and your mount, defending your mount from harm. Use your own AC against the triggering attack instead your mount's AC. If the triggering attack hits, you take the effects of the attack instead of your mount. MOUNTED SHIELD FEAT 6 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Cavalier Dedication You've trained with your shield to defend both yourself and your mount. When you {@action Raise a Shield} while mounted, both you and your mount gain the shield's circumstance bonus to AC. If you have the Shield Block reaction, you can use it in response to your mount taking damage, as long as you're CAVALIER PLEDGES Many cavaliers pledge themselves in service to a specific organization or individual, such as a noble family or sovereign ruler, a knightly order or another organization, or a particular ideal. A cavalier pledged to an order or ideal must uphold its edicts and is beholden to any anathema it has; for example, a cavalier pledged to the druid's animal order would be tied to that anathema, while a cavalier pledged to the church of Abadar would be held to the same standards as a cleric of that god. If you pledge yourself to an entity or cause without a stated anathema, you should work with your GM to determine the edicts and anathema associated with your pledge. Cavaliers who have pledged themselves can gain access to certain abilities related to that pledge, such as Cavalier's Banner. If you violate the anathema of your pledge, you lose access to those feats until you benefit from an atone ritual. Changing the subject of your pledge is equivalent to retraining a class feature. Cavalier You are a skilled and dedicated warrior of the battlefield who specializes in fighting astride a powerful animal companion that serves as your mount. You and your mount are an unparalleled team, moving with shared intent to become a powerful force on the battlefield. You might wield a banner in the name of a greater organization, a liege, or an ideal you uphold, or you might fight solely to further enrich your own prestige, reputation, and coffers. CAVALIER DEDICATION FEAT 2 ARCHETYPE DEDICATION Prerequisites trained in {@skill Nature} or {@skill Society} You gain a young animal companion (Core Rulebook 214) that serves as your mount. You can choose from animal companions with the mount special ability, as well as any additional options from your pledge, as determined by your GM. You must choose an animal companion that's at least one size larger than you, but if the animal usually starts as Small, you can begin with a Medium version of that animal (changing no statistics other than its size). Special You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the cavalier archetype. This restriction is waived if you have pledged to the organization associated with the other dedication feat. For example, if you are pledged to a Hellknight order, you could take Hellknight dedication feats without needing to gain other feats from the cavalier archetype first. CAVALIER'S BANNER FEAT 4 UNCOMMON ARCHETYPE EMOTION MENTAL VISUAL Prerequisites Cavalier Dedication Requirements You have pledged your service to a specific organization or ideal (see Cavalier Pledges sidebar). You fly the banner of your pledge from your mount, raising your allies' spirits. You and all allies within 30 feet gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Will saves and DCs against {@trait fear} effects. If your banner is destroyed or removed, allies within 30 feet become {@condition frightened|CRB|frightened 1}.

At any point during this movement, you can {@action Strike} one enemy within reach or within the first range increment of a ranged weapon. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll. IMPRESSIVE MOUNT FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Cavalier Dedication You've trained your mount to become a powerful force on the battlefield. The mount you gained through the Cavalier riding your mount. If you do, the shield prevents your mount from taking damage instead of preventing you from taking damage, following the normal rules for Shield Block. INCREDIBLE MOUNT FEAT 8 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Impressive {@action Mount} Under your care and training, your mount has realized its innate potential. The mount you gained through the Cavalier Dedication feat becomes a nimble or savage animal companion (your choice), gaining additional capabilities determined by the type of companion. TRAMPLING CHARGE {@as 3} FEAT 10 ARCHETYPE FLOURISH Prerequisites Cavalier Dedication Requirements You are riding a mount that has a melee {@action Strike} using its legs (claw, talons, hoof, etc.). You urge your mount forward, trampling enemies in your path. You command your mount to {@action Stride} up to its Speed (or to {@action Burrow}, {@action Climb}, {@action Fly}, or {@action Swim}, if it has the corresponding movement type), moving through the spaces of any foes in your path up to one size smaller than your mount. Your mount deals damage equal to the melee {@action Strike} using its legs to each creature whose space you move through, subject to a basic Reflex save against your mount's {@skill Athletics} DC. On a critical failure, the creature also becomes {@condition flat-footed} until the end of your next turn. You can damage a given creature only once during this movement. UNSEAT {@as 1} FEAT 10 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Cavalier Dedication Requirements You are riding your mount and wielding a jousting weapon. You attempt to knock an opponent off their mount. Make a melee {@action Strike} against a mounted opponent. If your attack hits, attempt an {@skill Athletics} check against the opponent's Fortitude DC. If you succeed, the foe is knocked off its mount into a space of its choice adjacent to its mount. If you critically succeed, it lands {@condition prone}. SPECIALIZED MOUNT FEAT 14 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Incredible {@action Mount} You've trained your mount to perform in unusual or even extreme circumstances, granting it abilities far beyond others of its kind.

You mount can't have more than three specializations.

Whenever you are riding your mount, you are {@condition quickened}; you can use the extra action only to command your mount using the {@action Command an Animal} skill action. Celebrity You're a special personality... and you know it. You're not merely comfortable in the spotlight, you crave it. While the traditional celebrity is a musician or another type of performer, you could be known for any occupation. CELEBRITY DEDICATION FEAT 2 ARCHETYPE DEDICATION The more people you have looking at you, the more content you are, and you take every opportunity to show up others when their performances are less than perfect. You gain the Upstage reaction. In addition, when you {@action Earn Income}, if the level of the task is higher than your level, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your check to {@action Earn Income}. Upstage {@as R} Trigger A foe attempts a skill check and doesn't get a critical success; Effect After your foe has tried their best, you show everyone how it's really done. Attempt a check using the same skill that triggered this reaction. Critical Success You gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, Perception checks, saving throws, and skill checks until the end of your next turn. Success As critical success, except you gain the benefits only if the triggering creature failed their skill check. Special You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the celebrity archetype. NEVER TIRE {@as R} FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Celebrity Dedication Trigger You would gain the {@condition fatigued} condition. Requirements You are {@condition observed} by at least three creatures who aren't foes. As long as you have an audience, you can continue to perform. Indeed, you must\u2014you have an obligation to your fans! You delay the effects of the {@condition fatigued} condition for 1 minute or until you are no longer {@condition observed} by the required creatures, whichever comes first. If the {@condition fatigued} condition has a duration, the duration begins to elapse only after the delay. You can't further delay or prevent the {@condition fatigued} condition after this ability ends. MESMERIZING GAZE {@as 2} FEAT 6 ARCHETYPE EMOTION ENCHANTMENT MENTAL VISUAL Prerequisites Celebrity Dedication When you meet someone's gaze, they are unable to look away. Choose one target creature. That creature must succeed at a Will save or be {@condition fascinated} until the end of your next turn; the DC for this save is equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. If the creature succeeds at its save or its fascination ends due to a {@condition hostile} action, it becomes temporarily immune to your Mesmerizing Gaze for 1 day. When you select this feat, it gains either the {@trait arcane} or {@trait occult} trait; once you make this choice, you can't change it. COMMAND ATTENTION {@as 1} FEAT 10 ARCHETYPE AUDITORY EMOTION ENCHANTMENT MENTAL VISUAL Prerequisites Celebrity Dedication You command the attention of all around you with style, ensuring their gaze falls only upon you until the end of your next turn. When creatures within 30 feet of you attempt saving throws against other {@trait visual} effects, they use the outcome for one degree of success better than the result they rolled. An enemy within the area attempting to use a {@trait visual} effect that involves focusing its attention on a particular creature (such as a medusa's Focus Gaze) must succeed at a Will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, in order to target any creature except you. Allies in the area can attempt to {@action Hide} even if they don't have cover, as you are continually providing a distraction. Dandy You are a genteel master of style, culture, and decorum, aware of even the subtlest rules of etiquette. Whether you were born into status, acquired it later in life, or merely pretend to possess it, you look and act your part to manicured perfection. DANDY DEDICATION FEAT 2 ARCHETYPE DEDICATION Prerequisites trained in {@skill Diplomacy} You are a consummate student of dignity, etiquette, and fashion. You can use the {@skill Diplomacy} skill to perform the special downtime activity Influence Rumor, spending at least one day of downtime to manipulate the course, tone, or content of a rumor to your benefit. The difficulty of Influencing a Rumor is determined by the GM based on the size of the community, the relative perceptiveness of the inhabitants, and the agency of other rumormongers, but it typically starts with at least DC 15 for a small village and increases to at least DC 20 for a town, at least DC 30 for a city, and at least DC 40 for a metropolis. You become trained in {@skill Deception} and {@skill Society}; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. Special You can't select another Dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the dandy archetype. DISTRACTING FLATTERY {@as R} FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE SKILL Prerequisites Dandy Dedication, expert in {@skill Deception} Trigger You observe a target's attitude toward yourself or your allies decrease as a result of an ally's behavior. You know how to maintain a good impression and manage your image, even while keeping uncouth company. Make a {@skill Deception} check against the target's Will DC. Regardless of your result, the target is temporarily immune to your Distracting Flattery for 10 minutes. Success The target's attitude doesn't decrease as a result of your ally's social blunder. Failure The target's attitude decreases, as normal. Critical Failure Your attempt makes matters worse, decreasing the target's attitude toward you by one step, in addition to any changes from the behavior that triggered this reaction. GOSSIP LORE FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Dandy Dedication Your time gossiping in fashionable salons keeps you informed on every topic. You are trained in {@skill Lore|Gossip Lore}, a special {@skill Lore} skill that can be used only to {@action Recall Knowledge}, but on any topic. If you fail a check to {@action Recall Knowledge} with {@skill Lore|Gossip Lore}, you get the effects of the Dubious Knowledge skill feat (Core Rulebook 260). If you have legendary proficiency in {@skill Society}, you gain expert proficiency in {@skill Lore|Gossip Lore}, but you can't increase your proficiency rank in {@skill Lore|Gossip Lore} by any other means. FABRICATED CONNECTIONS FEAT 7 ARCHETYPE SKILL Prerequisites Dandy Dedication, master in {@skill Deception} You can lie about having taken an action so convincingly that you acquire all the tangible benefits of having successfully completed it. You can roll {@skill Deception} in place of a different skill when attempting to {@action Earn Income}, {@action Make an Impression}, {@action Request}, or {@action Subsist}. You can use Fabricated Connections to {@action Make an Impression} or {@action Request} once per day, and you can also use it once per week to {@action Earn Income} or {@action Subsist}. PARTY CRASHER FEAT 7 ARCHETYPE SKILL Prerequisites Dandy Dedication, master in {@skill Society} You attend all the fashionable society parties, no matter how exclusive they might be. Any time you encounter a social event you would ordinarily be denied access to, such as a coronation, royal gala, or other society function, you can spend {@dice 1d4} hours to secure entry without the need for a skill check. You find invitations, invitees looking for fashionable dates, temporary jobs with the caterers, event staff willing to look the other way, or some other mode of access for yourself and your allies. This ability doesn't apply to secret events or other small private gatherings with no staff, dates, or outsiders involved. Dragon Disciple The rippling waves of fear, the rustling of thick scales, and the beat of immense wings signal the arrival of a great dragon. The awe-inspiring presence of these creatures makes them worthy of reverence\u2014or even outright worship. Dragon disciples dedicate themselves to becoming like these great beasts, with each disciple striving to typify one variety of dragon. Sorcerers of draconic blood, barbarians with the dragon instinct, and many kobolds with close ties to their draconic predecessors become dragon disciples, but anyone who has encountered one of these terrifying creatures might follow this path. As a dragon disciple, you study and learn from the example of dragons, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you admire the dragons you emulate. While most dragon disciples do indeed revere their chosen dragon, countless tales are told of dragon disciples born of great personal tragedy at the hands of boundless draconic fury. These disciples have transformed themselves into what they despise in order to gain the power to destroy their draconic tormentor and at long last earn their revenge. DRAGON DISCIPLE DEDICATION FEAT 2 UNCOMMON ARCHETYPE DEDICATION Access You are a kobold with the dragonscaled or spellscaled heritage, a dragon instinct barbarian, or a draconic bloodline sorcerer. You choose to study or worship one type of dragon, and your focus grants you a measure of its power. Choose one color of dragon when you select this feat; if you are a sorcerer with the draconic bloodline, this must be the same type as your bloodline. You gain resistance equal to half your level against one type of damage determined by the chosen dragon type. The GM may allow you to choose a dragon type not listed below, and will determine the damage type appropriate for that dragon. • Black or Copper Acid • Blue or Bronze Electricity • Brass, Gold, or Red Fire • Green Poison • Silver or White Cold You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against {@trait sleep} effects and effects that would make you {@condition paralyzed}. Special You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the dragon disciple archetype. If you later take the sorcerer archetype, you must choose the draconic bloodline. CLAWS OF THE DRAGON FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Dragon Disciple Dedication Your fingernails grow into razor-sharp claws, and scales speckle your fingers, hands, and wrists. Your claws are agile, finesse unarmed attacks that deal {@damage 1d6} slashing damage and are in the brawling weapon group. If you're a draconic sorcerer, when you cast {@spell dragon claws}, increase the spell's slashing damage die from d4 to d6 and increase the resistance to 10 at 1st level, 15 at 5th level, and 20 at 9th level. DRACONIC SCENT FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Dragon Disciple Dedication Your sense of smell is uncanny, much like a dragon's. You gain imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet. The GM might double the range if you're downwind from the creature or halve the range if you're upwind, at their discretion. DRAGON ARCANA FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites ability to cast spells from spell slots, Dragon Disciple Dedication You've discovered how to add the magic of dragons to your tradition. Add the draconic bloodline's granted spells to your spell list; you must still learn them or add them to your repertoire as normal. These spells are shield, true strike, resist energy, haste, spell immunity, chromatic wall, dragon form, mask of terror, prismatic wall, and overwhelming presence. INSTINCT OF THE WYRM The acquisition of draconic might can change the dragon disciple's body and give them magical abilities, as reflected in the archetype's feats, but the mind often changes as well, potentially even overwhelming the disciple's normal personality. Any dragon disciple can find the attitudes of dragonkind intruding into their thoughts. The foremost emotion among all types of dragons is pride. Even the influence of a benevolent metallic dragon can overwhelm a dragon disciple with pride. When tempered, this feeling levels out to a steady confidence, but when uncontrolled, it can grow to an air of arrogance or superiority. Disciples of metallic dragons also feel the pangs of compassion and benevolence. They grow to be more focused on cooperation and might take on leadership roles. Disciples of the vile chromatic dragons are plagued by thoughts of cruelty and greed. They long to see fear in the eyes of foe and friend alike. Those who succumb to these thoughts become bullies or tyrants. Instinctual draconic feelings can be constant, yet they seem to intensify when the disciple uses their draconic powers. In the few seconds after using a breath weapon or attacking with claws, or when the disciple sprouts wings, they might have a moment of mental transformation. This can bring on the full mindset of a dragon, or even make the disciple temporarily believe they truly are a dragon, and is often accompanied by a draconic roar, cackle, or majestic display. SCALES OF THE DRAGON FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Dragon Disciple Dedication Scales grow across your body, protecting you against physical and magical threats. When you're unarmored, the scales give you a +2 status bonus to AC with a Dexterity cap of +2. Your resistance from Dragon Disciple Dedication increases to 3 + half your level. BREATH OF THE DRAGON FEAT 8 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Dragon Disciple Dedication You can use a powerful breath weapon, much like the dragon you emulate. You gain the dragon breath sorcerer bloodline spell and a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. If you already have a focus pool, increase your number of Focus Points by 1. WINGS OF THE DRAGON FEAT 12 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Dragon Disciple Dedication You can manifest draconic wings to soar through the air at great speed. You gain the dragon wings sorcerer bloodline spell and a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. If you already have a focus pool, increase your number of Focus Points by 1. SHAPE OF THE DRAGON FEAT 14 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Dragon Disciple Dedication You've discovered how to transform yourself into a dragon. Once per day, you can cast 7th-level {@spell dragon form} as an innate arcane spell, transforming into your chosen type of dragon. The spell automatically heightens to 8th level if you're 16th level and 9th level if you're 18th level. Any time you score a critical hit with an unarmed {@action Strike} gained from dragon form, you recharge the spell's breath weapon immediately. DISCIPLE'S BREATH {@as 2} FEAT 16 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Dragon Disciple Dedication, dragon breath sorcerer bloodline spell You unleash your breath weapon without spending focus. This has the effects of your dragon breath sorcerer bloodline spell, though it deals {@dice 9d6} damage instead of its usual damage, and you don't have to cast it or spend a Focus Point. You can't use Disciple's Breath again for {@dice 1d4} rounds. MIGHTY DRAGON SHAPE FEAT 18 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Shape of the Dragon You've practiced and increased your draconic might, allowing you to take your draconic form more often. You can use Shape of the Dragon once per hour instead of once per day. Dual-Weapon Warrior You're able to effortlessly fight with multiple weapons simultaneously, weaving your weapons together into a storm of quick attacks. To you, continual offense is the best form of defense, and you leave little room for your foes to avoid your whirlwind of weapons. Additional Feats: 6th Twin Parry (Core Rulebook 147); 12th Twin Riposte (Core Rulebook 151); 16th Improved Twin Riposte (Core Rulebook 153), Two-Weapon Flurry (Core Rulebook 153); 18th Twinned Defense (Core Rulebook 153) DUAL-WEAPON WARRIOR DEDICATION FEAT 2 ARCHETYPE DEDICATION You're exceptional in your use of two weapons. You gain the Double Slice fighter feat (Core Rulebook 144). This serves as Double Slice for the purpose of meeting prerequisites. Special You can't select another dedication feat until you gain two other feats from the dual-weapon warrior archetype. DUAL THROWER FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication You know how to throw two weapons as easily as strike with them. Whenever a dual-weapon warrior feat allows you to make a melee {@action Strike}, you can instead make a ranged {@action Strike} with a thrown weapon or a one-handed ranged weapon you are wielding. {@trait Any} effects from these feats that apply to one-handed melee weapons or melee Strikes also apply to one-handed ranged weapons and ranged Strikes. DUAL-WEAPON RELOAD {@as 1} FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication Requirements You are wielding two one-handed weapons, each in a different hand, one of which is a ranged weapon. You carry your ammunition in a way that allows you to reload while holding two weapons. You {@action Interact} to reload a one-handed ranged weapon you're holding. Unlike most {@action Interact} actions, you don't need a free hand to reload your ranged weapon in this way. FLENSING SLICE {@as 1} FEAT 8 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication Requirements Your last action was a Double Slice, and both attacks hit the target. When you hit with both attacks with Double Slice, you flense the target, making it bleed and creating a weak spot. The target takes {@damage 1d8} {@condition persistent damage ||persistent bleed damage} per weapon damage die of whichever of the weapons you used that has the most weapon damage dice (maximum {@dice 4d8} for a major striking weapon). The target becomes {@condition flat-footed}, and its resistances to any physical damage types are reduced by 5; these two effects last until the beginning of your next turn. DUAL-WEAPON BLITZ {@as 2} FEAT 10 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication Requirements You are wielding two one-handed melee weapons, each in a different hand. You attack as you dash among foes. {@action Stride} up to your Speed. At any point during this movement, you can {@action Strike} once with each of the two required weapons. These Strikes can be against the same or different targets, as you see fit. DUAL ONSLAUGHT FEAT 14 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Dual-Weapon Dedication When you lash out with both weapons, you leave no room for the target to escape your attack. When you use Double Slice, if you miss with both Strikes, choose one of the two weapons and apply the effects of a hit with that weapon. You can't choose a weapon if your attack roll with that weapon was a critical failure, meaning you still miss entirely if both attack rolls were critical failures. Duelist Across the world, students in martial academies practice with their blades to master one-on-one combat. The libraries of such schools hold deep troves of information detailing hundreds of combat techniques, battle stances, and honorable rules of engagement. Those who gain admission to such schools might train in formalized duels\u2014and that's certainly the more genteel route to take. However, others assert that there's no better place to try out dueling techniques than in the life-and-death struggles common to an adventurer's life. Additional Feats: 4th Dueling Parry (Core Rulebook 146); 8th Disarming Stance (Core Rulebook 147); 10th Dueling Riposte (Core Rulebook 149); 12th Disarming Twist (Core Rulebook 150); 14th Dueling Dance (Core Rulebook 151), Improved Dueling Riposte (Core Rulebook 151); 16th Guiding Riposte (Core Rulebook 151) DUELIST DEDICATION FEAT 2 ARCHETYPE DEDICATION Prerequisites trained in light armor and simple weapons You are always ready to draw your weapon and begin a duel, no matter the circumstances. You gain the Quick Draw ranger feat (Core Rulebook 172), enabling you to both draw and attack with a weapon as 1 action. This serves as Quick Draw for the purpose of meeting prerequisites. Special You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the duelist archetype. DUELIST'S CHALLENGE {@as 1} FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE OPEN Prerequisites Duelist Dedication Select one foe that you can see and proclaim a challenge. That foe is your dueling opponent until they are defeated, flee, or the encounter ends. Any time you hit that enemy using a single one-handed melee weapon while your other hand or hands are free, you gain a circumstance bonus to the {@action Strike}'s damage equal to the number of damage dice your weapon deals. If you attack a creature other than your dueling opponent, you take a circumstance penalty to damage equal to the number of damage dice your weapon deals. SELFLESS PARRY FEAT 8 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Dueling Parry, Duelist Dedication You protect those near you with a flash of steel. When you're benefiting from Dueling Parry, allies adjacent to you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC. If you have Dueling Riposte, you can use it when an enemy within your reach critically fails a {@action Strike} against an ally adjacent to you, not just against yourself. STUDENT OF THE DUELING ARTS FEAT 12 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Duelist Dedication You have studied a great many combat techniques, which you can review each day. During your daily preparations, you can swap out any number of your duelist archetype feats for other duelist archetype feats of the appropriate level for which you are qualified. You can't swap out Duelist Dedication or Student of the Dueling Arts in this way.

Bolstering your athletic and martial abilities with mystical talents, you achieve rare heights with the bow or crossbow\u2014transforming arrows or bolts into eldritch ammunition, sending arrows zig-zagging nearly unerringly to their target, and manifesting arrows that can deliver spells or even instant death. While having some spellcasting ability increases your potential flexibility and power as an eldritch archer, you might learn the secrets of these arts without being independently skilled in spellcasting, instead learning the magic of the bow for its own sake. Additional Feats: 20th Impossible Volley (Core Rulebook 153) ELDRITCH ARCHER DEDICATION FEAT 6 ARCHETYPE DEDICATION MAGICAL Prerequisites expert in at least one type of bow You blend magic with your archery, leading to powerful results. If you don't already cast spells from spell slots, you learn to cast spontaneous spells and gain the {@action Cast a Spell} activity. You gain a spell repertoire with one cantrip of your choice, from a spell list of your choice. You choose this cantrip from the common spells on your chosen spell list or from other spells to which you have access on that list. This cantrip must require a spell attack roll. You're trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for that tradition. Your key spellcasting ability for these spells is Charisma. If you already cast spells from spell slots, you learn one additional cantrip from that tradition. If you're a prepared caster, you can prepare this spell in addition to your usual cantrips per day; if you're a spontaneous caster, you add this cantrip to your spell repertoire. You also gain Eldritch Shot. Eldritch Shot {@as 3} Requirements You are wielding a bow; Effect You {@action Cast a Spell} that takes 1 or 2 actions to cast and requires a spell attack roll. The effects of the spell do not occur immediately but are imbued into the bow you're wielding. Make a {@action Strike} with that bow. Your spell flies with the ammunition, using your attack roll result to determine the effects of both the {@action Strike} and the spell. This counts as two attacks for your multiple attack penalty, but you don't apply the penalty until after you've completed both attacks. Special You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the eldritch archer archetype. BASIC ELDRITCH ARCHER SPELLCASTING FEAT 8 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Eldritch Archer Dedication You gain the basic spellcasting benefits (page 150). Each time you gain a spell slot of a new level from this archetype, add a spell of the appropriate spell level to your repertoire, either a common spell of your chosen tradition or another spell of that tradition you have learned or discovered. Eldritch Archer While many archers see their craft as an art form as much as a means of battle, a small number of archers seek to perfect their skills through magic, and you ENCHANTING ARROW {@as 2} FEAT 8 ARCHETYPE EMOTION ENCHANTMENT MAGICAL MENTAL Prerequisites Eldritch Archer Dedication With a single whisper carried on the wind, you enchant your ammunition to make a foe more vulnerable to your attacks. Make a bow {@action Strike}. On a hit, the target takes an additional {@damage 2d6} mental damage. On a critical hit, the target also becomes {@condition stunned|CRB|stunned 1}. The mental damage increases to {@dice 3d6} if your bow has a greater striking rune, or to {@dice 4d6} if your bow has a major striking rune. MAGIC ARROW {@as F} FEAT 8 ARCHETYPE MAGICAL TRANSMUTATION Prerequisites Eldritch Archer Dedication Frequency once per round You imbue your ammunition with eldritch power. When you select this feat, choose three types of common magical ammunition of 4th level or lower from the Core Rulebook (page 559) or this book (pages 256\u2013259). Your GM might allow you to choose from other types of magical ammunition, such as uncommon ammunition, or ammunition from other books. When using Magic Arrow, you transform a non-magical arrow or bolt into a piece of ammunition of one type you chose. You must shoot the ammunition before the end of your turn or the magic dissipates. If the ammunition has an Activate entry, you still need to spend the required actions to activate the ammunition before shooting it. When you use Magic Arrow, you can choose a type of magical ammunition that is typically not available to the type of ammunition you're using\u2014for example, you can use climbing bolt on an arrow, even though that magical ammunition is normally only found on bolts. Special You can select this feat multiple times. Each time you do, select three additional types of ammunition as described above. PRECIOUS ARROW {@as 1} FEAT 8 ARCHETYPE MAGICAL TRANSMUTATION Prerequisites Eldritch Archer Dedication You enchant a piece of ammunition with the magical essence of a precious material, allowing you to leverage certain creatures' weaknesses. Choose cold iron or silver; if you shoot the arrow before the end of your turn, it counts as that material. At 14th level, add adamantine to the list of materials you can choose from. EXPERT ELDRITCH ARCHER SPELLCASTING FEAT 12 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Basic Eldritch Archer Spellcasting You gain the expert spellcasting benefits (page 150). SEEKER ARROW {@as 1} FEAT 14 ARCHETYPE DIVINATION MAGICAL Prerequisites Eldritch Archer Dedication Your shots zip around corners and fly at impossible angles to reach your target. Make a bow {@action Strike} against a foe you can see; the ammunition travels to your target, even around corners. You ignore the target's {@condition concealed} condition and all cover. PHASE ARROW {@as 1} FEAT 16 ARCHETYPE CONJURATION MAGICAL Prerequisites Eldritch Archer Dedication Frequency once per day You can concentrate an immense amount of magic to create a piece of ammunition that phases through everything but your target. Make a bow {@action Strike} against a foe who is {@condition observed} or {@condition hidden} to you (but not {@condition undetected}). The ammunition travels to your target in a straight line, passing through any non-magical barriers or walls in its way, though magical barriers stop the arrow. The shot ignores all cover, the {@condition concealed} condition, the {@condition hidden} condition, and circumstance bonuses to AC from shields. It has a +4 status bonus to hit creatures wearing any type of armor. The {@action Strike}'s damage can't be reduced with a Shield Block reaction using a non-magical shield. ARROW OF DEATH {@as 3} FEAT 18 ARCHETYPE MAGICAL NECROMANCY Prerequisites Eldritch Archer Dedication Frequency once per day You modify an arrow or bolt to bring death to your target in a single potent hit.

MASTER ELDRITCH ARCHER SPELLCASTING FEAT 18 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Expert Eldritch Archer Spellcasting You gain the master spellcasting benefits (page 150). ELVEN ARROWS The ability to infuse eldritch energy into bow shots is often seen as a kind of elven magic. While it may be true that elves first developed eldritch archery as a martial art, and many eldritch archers are elves and half-elves, other peoples have learned and developed their own forms of eldritch archery. Some whisper that remote regions to the south have their own dedications that rely on elemental archery, while the strange and shadowy hunters of the Uskwood use a form that relies on tenebrous shadow magic. Disturbing rumors circulate claiming that devils have developed a diabolical form of magical archery that can trap the soul and bind it to Hell, albeit for a short time. Like any form of magic, the discipline of eldritch archery will continue to develop among its practitioners across the multiverse. Familiar Master From the wise owl perched on the wizard's shoulder to the crafty gremlin that serves the witch for their own reasons, the ghastly homunculus in the alchemist's lab to the clever monkey that picks the lock of the thief's cell, familiars have always served. Whether through rigorous training or a preternatural connection, yours serves better than most. Additional Feats: 4th Enhanced Familiar (Pathfinder Core Rulebook 198) FAMILIAR MASTER DEDICATION FEAT 2 ARCHETYPE DEDICATION You have forged a mystical bond with a creature. This might have involved complex rituals and invocations, such as meditating under the moon until something crept out of the forest. Or maybe you just did each other a good turn, such as rescuing the beast from a trap or a foe, and then being rescued in turn. Whatever the details, you are now comrades until the end. You gain a familiar (Core Rulebook 198). If you already have a familiar, you gain the Enhanced Familiar feat (Core Rulebook 198). Special You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the familiar master archetype. FAMILIAR MASCOT FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Familiar Master Dedication Your familiar is the heart and soul of your adventuring team.

INCREDIBLE FAMILIAR FEAT 10 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Enhanced Familiar Your familiar is infused with even more magic than other familiars. You can select six familiar or master abilities each day, instead of four. Gladiator The roar of the crowd and thrill of competitive combat drive you to become the best\u2014and the fame isn't bad either. If there are sapient creatures observing a combat encounter, and these onlookers are neither engaged in the combat themselves nor allied or affiliated with either side, the combatants have spectators. The GM is the final arbiter. GLADIATOR DEDICATION FEAT 2 ARCHETYPE DEDICATION Prerequisites Impressive {@skill Performance} You know how to turn combat into a form of entertainment. You become trained in {@skill Lore|Gladiatorial Lore}; if already trained in {@skill Lore|Gladiatorial Lore}, you instead become trained in another {@skill Lore} skill of your choice.

Your advanced alchemy level for creating these is 1 and doesn't increase on its own. You become an expert in {@skill Nature} and can use {@skill Nature} instead of {@skill Crafting} to {@action Craft} herbal items. You don't need to be trained in {@skill Crafting} or have the Alchemical {@skill Crafting} feat to do so, and you can use healer's tools instead of alchemist's tools. Special You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the herbalist archetype. FRESH INGREDIENTS FEAT 2 ARCHETYPE SKILL Prerequisites Herbalist Dedication, expert in {@skill Nature} When using Natural {@skill Medicine} to {@action Treat Wounds}, you can spend a batch of herbs to gain the +2 circumstance bonus from having fresh ingredients, even if not in wilderness.

Until your next preparations, you can spend an additional batch of herbs to add a benefit to an item you create with your herbalism. The benefit of the special herbs affects the creature that the item is applied to; if the benefit is not immediate, it lasts for 1 minute unless otherwise stated.

Special You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the horizon walker archetype. ACCLIMATIZATION FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Horizon Walker Dedication Your time spent in the {@condition hostile} parts of the world has inured you to extreme climates. In your favored terrain, you gain resistance equal to half your level to all environmental damage and are affected by temperature effects as though they were one step less severe (incredible heat or cold becomes extreme, extreme heat or cold becomes severe, and so on). When other creatures {@action Follow the Expert} with you as a guide in your favored terrain, they too treat temperature effects as one step less severe. SURE FOOT FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE SKILL Prerequisites Horizon Walker Dedication, expert in {@skill Acrobatics} and {@skill Athletics} You know the secrets of moving in your favored terrain. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to skill checks to move within your favored terrain, such as {@skill Acrobatics} checks to {@action Balance} on ice, {@skill Athletics} checks to {@action Swim} in rough water, {@skill Acrobatics} checks to {@action Fly} in windy conditions, and so forth. PERPETUAL SCOUT FEAT 6 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Horizon Walker Dedication You spot anything out of place in the areas you know best.

If you interact with someone for at least 10 minutes, their regional words, pronunciation changes, and nonverbal cues provide you with a minor fact about their social environment, such as their hometown or certain groups they might belong to. If a target of this ability is being deceptive about their social environment, such as a commoner pretending to be a noble, they must attempt a {@skill Deception}, {@skill Society}, or appropriate {@skill Lore} check against your {@skill Society} DC, providing you a false minor fact consistent with their assumed identity on a success. Once you've gleaned one or more true minor facts about a person, you can then incorporate these mannerisms into your speech to present yourself in a way that they find familiar. This grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to your {@skill Diplomacy} and {@skill Deception} checks with them. CRUDE COMMUNICATION FEAT 8 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Linguist Dedication Even if you don't speak a creature's language, you can rely on inflection, root words, and body language to infer rudimentary meaning. If you interact with a creature for at least 10 minutes and that creature can speak a language, the GM rolls a secret {@skill Society} check with a DC appropriate for the language's rarity.

If you're legendary in {@skill Society}, you can communicate instantly without needing to attempt a {@skill Society} check; even if you didn't know the medium of communication the creature uses (speech, sign language, and so on), you intuit this information as soon as they try to communicate. {@skill Lore}master Knowledge is power, and you labor in pursuit of that power. No matter the situation, you can usually procure some tidbit of knowledge to inform your actions.

Alternatively, you can reference your notes to instead choose a {@skill Lore} skill you've prepared before with Quick Study. This proficiency lasts until you prepare again. Since this proficiency is temporary, you can't use it as a prerequisite for a skill increase or a permanent character option like a feat. GREATER MAGICAL EDIFICATION FEAT 10 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Magical Edification You've continued to expand your compendium of tools to compile knowledge. You can cast {@spell comprehend language}, mindlink, and secret page as innate occult spells, each once per day.

Some marshals lead from the front, sword and shield raised, while others may call instructions and encouragements from the rear while providing allied spellcasters with skilled support. Regardless of their preferred method of combat, marshals' ability to bring the best out in every ally is a valuable addition to any group.

STEEL YOURSELF! {@as 1} FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE AUDITORY EMOTION MENTAL Prerequisites Marshal Dedication You encourage an ally to toughen up, giving them a fighting chance. Choose one ally within your marshal's aura. The ally gains temporary Hit Points equal to your Charisma modifier and a +2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves. Both benefits last until the start of your next turn. CADENCE CALL {@as 1} FEAT 6 ARCHETYPE AUDITORY FLOURISH Prerequisites Marshal Dedication Frequency once per minute You call out a quick cadence, guiding your allies into a more efficient rhythm. Each willing ally within your marshal's aura is {@condition quickened} until the end of their next turn, and they can use the extra action only to {@action Stride}. At the end of each ally's turn, if they used the extra action, they then become {@condition slowed|CRB|slowed 1} until the end of their following turn. RALLYING CHARGE {@as 2} FEAT 6 ARCHETYPE OPEN VISUAL Prerequisites Marshal Dedication Your fearless charge into battle reinvigorates your allies to carry on the fight. You {@action Stride} up to your Speed and make a melee {@action Strike}. If your {@action Strike} hits and damages an enemy, each ally within 60 feet who saw you hit gains temporary Hit Points equal to your Charisma modifier. These temporary Hit Points last until the start of your next turn. BACK TO BACK FEAT 8 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Marshal Dedication You excel at watching your allies' backs and helping them watch yours. As long as you and an ally are adjacent to each other, neither of you can become {@condition flat-footed} due to flanking unless both of you are flanked. If you're adjacent to more than one ally, all eligible allies can benefit at a given time. The benefit is negated for everyone if at least you and any one eligible ally are flanked, but not if your allies are flanked and you aren't. TO BATTLE! {@as 1} OR {@as 2} FEAT 8 ARCHETYPE AUDITORY FLOURISH Prerequisites Marshal Dedication With a resounding cry, you rally your ally to the offensive. Choose one ally within your marshal's aura who has a reaction available. If you spend 1 action, that ally can use their reaction to immediately {@action Stride}. If you spend 2 actions, that ally can use their reaction to immediately {@action Strike}. TOPPLE FOE {@as R} FEAT 10 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Marshal Dedication, trained in {@skill Athletics} Trigger An ally succeeds at a melee {@action Strike} against an opponent you are both adjacent to. You take advantage of the opening created by your ally to tip your foe off their feet. Attempt an {@skill Athletics} check to {@action Trip} the target of the triggering attack. COORDINATED CHARGE {@as 2} FEAT 12 ARCHETYPE OPEN VISUAL Prerequisites Marshal Dedication You heroically dash into the fray, inspiring your allies to follow. You {@action Stride} up to your Speed and make a melee {@action Strike}. If your {@action Strike} hits and damages an enemy, each ally within 60 feet who saw you hit can use a reaction to {@action Stride}, but they each must end their {@action Stride} closer to the creature you hit than where they started. TACTICAL CADENCE FEAT 14 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Cadence Call Your remarkable breath control and concise instructions allow you to coordinate your allies more effectively. When you grant allies the {@condition quickened} condition using Cadence Call, they can use the extra action to either {@action Stride} or {@action Strike}, and they aren't {@condition slowed|CRB|slowed 1} on their following turn if they use the extra action. TARGET OF OPPORTUNITY {@as R} FEAT 14 ARCHETYPE MANIPULATE Prerequisites Marshal Dedication Trigger An ally succeeds at a ranged {@action Strike} against an opponent within your weapon's first range increment. Requirements You have a ranged or thrown weapon in hand. You capitalize on your ally's attack to create a coordinated barrage. Make a ranged {@action Strike} with a\u20132 penalty against the opponent targeted by the triggering attack. This {@action Strike} doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this {@action Strike}. If this {@action Strike} is successful, combine the damage from the attack with the damage from your ally's attack for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. Martial Artist You have trained in the martial arts, making your unarmed strikes lethal. You seek neither mysticism nor enlightenment, and you don't view this training as some greater path to wisdom. Yours is the way of the fist striking flesh, the hand turning aside the blade, and the devastating kick taking your enemy down. Your training is focused and practical, and since you have turned every part of your body into a weapon, you never find yourself without one. While you might have learned your techniques in a dojo or school focused on training the body, you might just as easily have learned them in street brawls and bar fights, combining instincts with intense athleticism for a deadly combination. Additional Feats: 4th Brawling Focus (Core Rulebook 160), Crane Stance (Core Rulebook 158), Dragon Stance (Core Rulebook 158), Gorilla Stance (page 128), Mountain Stance (Core Rulebook 159), Stumbling Stance (page 128), Tiger Stance (Core Rulebook 159), Wolf Stance (Core Rulebook 159); 8th Crane Flutter (Core Rulebook 161), Dragon Roar (Core Rulebook 161), Gorilla Pound (page 129), Mountain Stronghold (Core Rulebook 161), Stumbling {@action Feint} (page 129), Tiger Slash (Core Rulebook 161), Wolf Drag (Core Rulebook 162); 16th Mountain Quake (Core Rulebook 164) MARTIAL ARTIST DEDICATION FEAT 2 ARCHETYPE DEDICATION You have trained to use your fists as deadly weapons. The damage die for your fist unarmed attacks becomes {@dice 1d6} instead of {@dice 1d4}. You don't take the\u20132 circumstance penalty for making a lethal attack with your nonlethal unarmed attacks. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in certain weapons, you also gain that proficiency rank in all unarmed attacks. Special You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the martial artist archetype. FOLLOW-UP STRIKE {@as 1} FEAT 6 ARCHETYPE FLOURISH Prerequisites Martial Artist Dedication Requirements Your last action was a missed {@action Strike} with a melee unarmed attack. You have trained to use all parts of your body as a weapon, and when you miss with an attack, you can usually continue the attack with a different body part and still deal damage. Make another {@action Strike} with a melee unarmed attack, using the same multiple attack penalty as for the missed {@action Strike}, if any. GRIEVOUS BLOW {@as 2} FEAT 8 ARCHETYPE FLOURISH Prerequisites Martial Artist Dedication You know how to deliver focused, powerful blows that bypass your enemies' resistances. Make an unarmed melee {@action Strike}. This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty. If this {@action Strike} hits, you deal two extra weapon damage dice. If you are at least 18th level, increase this to three extra weapon damage dice. This attack also ignores an amount of resistance to physical damage, or to a specific physical damage type, equal to your level. PATH OF IRON {@as 3} FEAT 14 ARCHETYPE FLOURISH Prerequisites Martial Artist Dedication Frequency once per minute With a burst of effort, you weave a path through your enemies, striking each in turn as you move past them. You {@action Stride}; this movement doesn't trigger reactions. You can {@action Strike} up to three times at any point during your movement, each against a different enemy. Each attack counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but your multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until you have made all your attacks. Mauler You shove your way through legions of foes, knock enemies on all sides to the ground, and deal massive blows to anyone or anything that comes near. Additional Feats: 4th Knockdown (Core Rulebook 146), Power Attack (Core Rulebook 144); 12th Improved Knockdown (Core Rulebook 151); 14th Brutal Finish (Core Rulebook 151), Unbalancing Sweep (page 111) MAULER DEDICATION FEAT 2 ARCHETYPE DEDICATION Prerequisites Strength 14 You specialize in weapons that require two hands. You become trained in all simple and martial melee weapons that require two hands to wield or have the {@trait two-hand} trait. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in weapons, you also gain that proficiency rank in these weapons. If you are at least an expert in such a weapon, you gain access to the critical specialization effect with that weapon. Special You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the mauler archetype. CLEAR THE WAY {@as 2} FEAT 6 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Mauler Dedication Requirements You're wielding a melee weapon in two hands. You put your body behind your massive weapon and swing, shoving enemies to clear a wide path. You attempt to {@action Shove} up to five creatures adjacent to you, rolling a separate {@skill Athletics} check for each target. Then {@action Stride} up to half your Speed. This movement doesn't trigger reactions from any of the creatures you successfully Shoved. SHOVING SWEEP {@as R} FEAT 8 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Mauler Dedication, expert in {@skill Athletics} Trigger A creature within your reach leaves a square during a move action it's using. Requirements You are wielding a melee weapon in two hands. You swing your weapon at your foe, rebuffing them back. You attempt to {@action Shove} the triggering creature, ignoring the requirement that you have a hand free. The creature continues its movement after the {@action Shove}. HAMMER QUAKE {@as 3} FEAT 14 ARCHETYPE FLOURISH OPEN Prerequisites Mauler Dedication Requirements You're wielding a non-finesse melee weapon in two hands. You smash the ground with your weapon, knocking nearby creatures to the ground. Choose a square within your reach, including your own space. If there's a foe in the chosen square, {@action Strike} that foe with the required weapon. Then attempt to {@action Trip} every foe in the chosen square plus each square adjacent to that square, ignoring {@action Trip}'s requirement that you have a hand free. This counts as three attacks toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you've made the {@action Strike}, if any, and all the {@action Trip} attempts. AVALANCHE STRIKE {@as 3} FEAT 16 ARCHETYPE FLOURISH OPEN Prerequisites Mauler Dedication Requirements You are wielding a melee weapon in two hands. You attack all nearby adversaries. Make a melee {@action Strike} with the required weapon against each enemy within your melee reach. Each attack counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but don't increase your penalty until you have made all your attacks. Medic You've studied countless techniques for providing medical aid, making you a peerless doctor and healer. MEDIC DEDICATION FEAT 2 ARCHETYPE DEDICATION Prerequisites trained in {@skill Medicine}, Battle {@skill Medicine} You become an expert in {@skill Medicine}. When you succeed with Battle {@skill Medicine} or {@action Treat Wounds}, the target regains 5 additional HP at DC 20, 10 HP at DC 30, or 15 HP at DC 40. Once per day, you can use Battle {@skill Medicine} on a creature that's temporarily immune. If you're a master in {@skill Medicine}, you can do so once per hour. Special You can't select another dedication feat until you gain two other feats from the medic archetype. DOCTOR'S VISITATION {@as 1} OR {@as 2} FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE FLOURISH Prerequisites Medic Dedication You move to provide immediate care to those who need it. {@action Stride}, then use one of the following: Battle {@skill Medicine} or {@action Treat Poison}. You can spend a second action to instead {@action Stride} and then {@action Administer First Aid} or Treat a Condition (if you have it; see below). TREAT CONDITION {@as 2} FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE HEALING MANIPULATE SKILL Prerequisites Medic Dedication Requirements You are holding healer's tools, or you are wearing them and have a hand free. You treat an adjacent creature in an attempt to reduce the {@condition clumsy}, {@condition enfeebled}, or {@condition sickened} condition. If a creature has multiple conditions from this list, choose one. Attempt a counteract check against the condition, using your {@skill Medicine} modifier as your counteract modifier and the condition's source to determine the DC. You can't treat a condition that came from an artifact or effect above 20th level unless you have Legendary Medic; even if you do, the counteract DC increases by 10. Treating a Condition that is continually applied under certain circumstances (for instance, the {@condition enfeebled} condition a good character gains from carrying an unholy weapon) has no effect as long as the circumstances continue. Critical Success Reduce the condition value by 2. Success Reduce the condition value by 1. Critical Failure Increase the condition value by 1. HOLISTIC CARE FEAT 6 ARCHETYPE SKILL Prerequisites trained in {@skill Diplomacy}, Treat Condition You provide emotional and spiritual care. Add {@condition frightened}, {@condition stupefied}, and {@condition stunned} to the list of conditions you can reduce with Treat Condition. If the {@condition stunned} condition has a duration instead of a value, you can't use Treat Condition to reduce it. RESUSCITATE {@as 3} FEAT 16 ARCHETYPE HEALING MANIPULATE Prerequisites Medic Dedication, legendary in {@skill Medicine} Requirements You are holding healer's tools or are wearing them and have a hand free. Also, the target's body is mostly intact. You can use {@skill Medicine} to resuscitate the dead. Attempt a DC 40 {@skill Medicine} check to revive a dead creature that has been dead for no more than 3 rounds. If you succeed, the target returns to life with the effects of raise dead, except it still has the {@condition wounded} condition it had before {@condition dying}, increased by 1 (or {@condition wounded|CRB|wounded 1} if it wasn't {@condition wounded} before {@condition dying}). Whether you succeed or fail, the target is temporarily immune to Resuscitate for 1 day. Pirate You live a life of freedom, taking by force and intimidation all that you desire. You may be a privateer, raiding and plundering on behalf of a particular nation or another authority, or you may answer to no one but your own capricious whims. Either way, you rely on intimidation, wits, and combat prowess to take what you want from those you deem less deserving. Pirates have much in common with swashbucklers, and many pirates have the swashbuckler class (page 82) or archetype (page 153). Much like a swashbuckler's daring deeds, classic pirate maneuvers are often showy feats intended to impress, intimidate, and gain panache. For example, if you have the panache class feature and your {@skill Acrobatics} check for a Boarding Assault exceeds the very hard DC for your level, you would gain panache. PIRATE DEDICATION FEAT 2 ARCHETYPE DEDICATION Prerequisites trained in {@skill Intimidation} As a pirate, you sail the seas in search of enemy ships to plunder. You become trained in {@skill Lore|Sailing Lore}, or become an expert in it if you were already trained. You ignore the effects of difficult terrain or uneven ground caused by a ship's movement. Additionally, you gain the Boarding Assault action. Boarding Assault {@as 2} (flourish) Either {@action Stride} twice or attempt an {@skill Acrobatics} check (DC determined by the GM, but usually DC 20) to swing on a rope up to twice your Speed. If you boarded or disembarked from a boat or similar vehicle during this movement, you can make a melee {@action Strike} that deals one additional weapon damage die. Special You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the pirate archetype. PIRATE WEAPON TRAINING FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Pirate Dedication You're particularly skilled at wielding traditional pirate weapons. You become trained with the following weapons: hatchet, rapier, scimitar, and whip. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency with a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency rank for these weapons. ROPE RUNNER FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE SKILL Prerequisites trained in {@skill Acrobatics} and {@skill Athletics}, Pirate Dedication You run and climb across ropes and rigging almost as easily as on the ground. You gain a climb Speed of 15 feet, but only on ship's rigging or similar ropes. Whenever you succeed at an {@skill Athletics} check to {@action Climb} a rope or an {@skill Acrobatics} check to {@action Balance} on a rope, you get a critical success instead. You aren't {@condition flat-footed} while Climbing or Balancing on a rope. WALK THE PLANK {@as 2} FEAT 8 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Pirate Dedication You frighten a foe into moving where you want them, traditionally demanding they walk the plank. Attempt to {@action Demoralize} an opponent; this check gains the {@trait incapacitation} trait. On a success, in addition to the normal effects, you can also force the target to {@action Stride} up to its Speed. You choose the path the target takes, and it does so as part of your Walk the Plank action. You can't force the target to move into a harmful space (one where it will take damage, fall, provoke reactions, or similar) unless the result of your check to {@action Demoralize} was a critical success. The target then becomes temporarily immune to Walk the Plank for 24 hours. Poisoner People are so delightfully fragile when exposed to the glories of nature. The bite of a certain serpent makes the blood congeal to jelly. A particular stone, suitably powdered, causes hallucinations and delirium. The sap of a tree inflicts such pain that death seems preferable. You are a student of such dark wonders, making you a dangerous foe indeed. Additional Feats: 4th Poison Resistance (Core Rulebook 77), Subtle Delivery (page 106); 6th Poison Weapon (Core Rulebook 185), Tenacious Toxins (page 107); 8th Sticky Poison (page 107); 10th Improved Poison Weapon (Core Rulebook 187), Pinpoint Poisoner (page 107); 12th Improved Poison Weapon (Core Rulebook 187); 18th Chemical Contagion (page 107) POISONER DEDICATION FEAT 2 ARCHETYPE DEDICATION Prerequisites trained in {@skill Crafting} You make a point of always having a few toxins near at hand\u2014you never know when some arsenic or the like might prove useful. You gain the basic alchemy benefits (page 150), though they can be used only for alchemical poisons. You gain batches of infused reagents per day equal to your level. Your advanced alchemy level for creating these is 1 and doesn't increase on its own. Special You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained at least two other feats from the poisoner archetype. POISONER'S TWIST {@as 1} FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Poisoner Dedication, trained in {@skill Medicine} Requirements Your last action was a successful melee {@action Strike} that dealt damage against a target that is afflicted by a poison, and you know which poison. Poisons attack specific parts of the body\u2014one venom might target the lungs, another the circulatory system, while another deteriorates the nerves. You know how to take advantage of such weaknesses. You deal {@dice 1d6} damage of the required {@action Strike}'s damage type and {@damage 1d6} poison damage to the target. If you're at least 18th level, you deal {@dice 2d6} damage of each type. EXPERT POISONER FEAT 6 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Poisoner Dedication, expert in {@skill Crafting} Your advanced alchemy level for poison increases to your level\u20133. POISON COAT {@as R} FEAT 6 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Poisoner Dedication Trigger A creature adjacent to you hits you with a melee unarmed {@action Strike}. Requirements You have prepared your clothing to poison attackers (see below). In nature, certain animals are covered in venomous spines, such that even touching them is deadly. To use this reaction, you must have brushed poison onto your clothing or woven sharp poisoned needles into the garment's fabric. This takes 10 minutes and uses one dose of contact or injury poison. You can have only one such poison suffused into your clothing at a time. When you use this reaction, the triggering creature is exposed to the suffused poison. ACQUIRED TOLERANCE {@as R} FEAT 8 ARCHETYPE FORTUNE Prerequisites Poisoner Dedication Trigger You fail a save against a poison. A small amount of poison, taken at nonlethal doses, can help the body build up a resistance against a more deadly dosage. Reroll the triggering check and use the second result. Once you use Acquired Tolerance, you can continue to use it against the same type of poison that day, but you can't use it against a different type of poison until after you make your next daily preparations. For instance, if you used the reaction on a save against giant scorpion venom, you could use it again against giant scorpion venom even if it came from a different source, but you couldn't use it against nettleweed residue, lich dust, or another poison. Ritualist While some learn the art of ritual casting through rigorous study, other gifted individuals may find that a combination of natural talent and luck gives them surprising skill at performing rituals, whether they want that power or not. RITUALIST DEDICATION FEAT 4 UNCOMMON ARCHETYPE DEDICATION Prerequisites expert in {@skill Arcana}, {@skill Nature}, {@skill Occultism}, or {@skill Religion} You have begun to master the difficult art of casting rituals. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to all primary checks to perform a ritual. You learn two uncommon rituals with a level no higher than half your level; you must meet all prerequisites for casting the ritual to choose it. At 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter, you learn another uncommon ritual with a level no higher than half your level and for which you meet the prerequisites. You can cast these as the primary caster, but you can't teach them to anyone else or allow someone else to serve as primary caster unless they know the ritual as well. Special You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the ritualist archetype. If you retrain out of this feat, you lose the rituals learned from it. FLEXIBLE RITUALIST FEAT 6 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Ritualist Dedication You can perform two aspects of a ritual yourself. When you cast a ritual, you can reduce the number of secondary casters by 1. When you do, you must fulfill any requirements for the secondary caster, and you attempt the secondary check normally performed by that secondary caster. You can't replace a secondary caster who is the target of the spell (as in the atone ritual). RESOURCEFUL RITUALIST FEAT 6 ARCHETYPE SKILL Prerequisites Ritualist Dedication You can cast difficult rituals that might otherwise be just beyond your skill. You can attempt checks to cast a ritual that requires expert proficiency if you are trained, master proficiency if you are an expert, or legendary proficiency if you are a master. EFFICIENT RITUALS FEAT 8 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Ritualist Dedication You can perform some rituals in less time. If the ritual normally requires 1 day to cast, you can cast it in 4 hours. If it takes longer than 1 day, you cast it in half the number of days, rounded up. ASSURED RITUALIST FEAT 10 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Flexible Ritualist You can cover for a secondary caster's error. If you are the primary caster, after rolling all the secondary checks, choose one check on which the secondary caster rolled a failure or critical failure, and treat the result as one degree of success better. SPEEDY RITUALS FEAT 14 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Efficient Rituals You can perform rituals in only a fraction of the usual time. If a ritual has a casting time measured in days, you can cast it in an equal number of hours. If this results in a ritual longer than 8 hours, you split the ritual between multiple days, as normal for a ritual. {@action Scout} You're an expert in espionage and reconnaissance, able to skulk silently through the wilderness to gather intelligence, sneak through enemy lines to report to your comrades, or suddenly and decisively strike your foes. Your skills ease the difficulty of travel for you and your companions and keep you all on guard when you're approaching danger. Additional Feats: 12th Camouflage (Core Rulebook 174) SCOUT DEDICATION FEAT 2 ARCHETYPE DEDICATION Prerequisites trained in {@skill Stealth} and {@skill Survival} You are a highly skilled scout, capable of providing your allies a timely warning of any danger. You gain the {@action Scout}'s Warning ranger feat (Core Rulebook 172). When you're using the {@action Scout} exploration activity, you grant your allies a +2 circumstance bonus to their initiative rolls instead of a +1 circumstance bonus. Special You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the scout archetype. SCOUT'S CHARGE {@as 2} FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE FLOURISH Prerequisites {@action Scout} Dedication You meander around unpredictably, and then ambush your opponents without warning. Choose one enemy. {@action Stride}, {@action Feint} against that opponent, and then make a {@action Strike} against that foe. For your {@action Feint}, you can attempt a {@skill Stealth} check instead of the {@skill Deception} check that's usually required, because you use the terrain around you to catch your foe off-guard. TERRAIN SCOUT FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites {@action Scout} Dedication You gain the Terrain Stalker skill feat (Core Rulebook 267) twice, choosing a different terrain each time. If you {@action Avoid Notice} while exploring and any allies use {@action Follow the Expert} to follow you as you do so, you can choose one of those allies to gain the benefit of any one Terrain Stalker feat you have. FLEETING SHADOW {@as 2} FEAT 6 ARCHETYPE FLOURISH Prerequisites {@action Scout} Dedication You're able to quickly disappear and then move about stealthily. You {@action Hide}, then {@action Sneak} twice. SCOUT'S SPEED FEAT 6 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites {@action Scout} Dedication You move faster, especially when traveling, allowing you to scout ahead and report back without slowing your allies. You gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed. When calculating your travel speed, this increases to a +20-foot status bonus. SCOUT'S POUNCE {@as 2} FEAT 10 ARCHETYPE FLOURISH Prerequisites {@action Scout} Dedication Requirements You are {@condition hidden} from or {@condition undetected} by all of your opponents, and you aren't within 10 feet of any enemy. You leap from the shadows to strike your foes. {@action Stride} up to your Speed, then {@action Strike} twice. If you were {@condition hidden} or {@condition unnoticed} by the target of these Strikes, your foe is {@condition flat-footed} against both attacks. Your multiple attack penalty applies normally for both attacks. Scroll Trickster Magic has long been written down, and in myriad forms. From the classic rolled parchment to strings tied with a hundred intricate knots, from baked clay tablets covered with incisions to bound collections of bamboo slips, magic is everywhere. You just need to know how to read it. SCROLL TRICKSTER DEDICATION FEAT 2 ARCHETYPE DEDICATION Prerequisites trained in {@skill Arcana}, {@skill Nature}, {@skill Occultism}, or {@skill Religion} You've studied scrolls in depth. This might have been a comprehensive education in formal setting, or the sort of education where you somehow obtain a number of scrolls and try not to explode anything you didn't mean to explode. You gain the Trick Magic Item feat (Core Rulebook 268), and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to skill checks to Trick scrolls. If you roll a critical failure to Trick a Magic Item that's a scroll, you get a failure instead. Special You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the scroll trickster archetype. BASIC SCROLL CACHE FEAT 6 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Scroll Trickster Dedication You have a vast and overflowing collection of scroll scraps, riddled with errors and misspellings and leaking energy like a sieve. With enough care, you can coax these scroll scraps into functioning\u2014briefly. Each day during your daily preparations, you can create a single temporary scroll containing a 1st-level spell. The spell must be a common spell from the Core Rulebook, or another spell you learned via {@action Learn a Spell}, and it must come from a tradition in which you have the corresponding skill trained. This scroll is an unstable, temporary item and loses its magic the next time you make your daily preparations if you haven't already used it. It can't be used to Learn the Spell. At 8th level, add a second temporary scroll containing a 2nd-level spell. SKIM SCROLL {@as 1} FEAT 8 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Scroll Trickster Dedication You can activate the magic of a scroll with a cursory read as you draw it from your belt. You {@action Interact} to draw forth a scroll, then use Trick Magic Item on the scroll. EXPERT SCROLL CACHE FEAT 12 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Basic Scroll Cache Your scroll collection is more powerful. In addition to your daily scrolls from Basic Scroll Cache, add a scroll with a 3rd-level spell. At 14th level, add a scroll with a 4th-level spell. At 16th level, add a scroll with a 5th-level spell. MASTER SCROLL CACHE FEAT 18 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Expert Scroll Cache Your scroll collection is incredible, brimming with eldritch power, and you can prepare far more of them than an ordinary scroll trickster. In addition to your daily scrolls from the Basic and Expert Scroll Caches, add a single scroll with a 6th-level spell. At 20th level, add a scroll with a 7th-level spell. Scrounger You have spent countless hours disassembling and rebuilding complex items to learn how they work, giving you the skill to create just about anything from the most unlikely materials. While your improvised items don't last long, they tend to be just what you need in a pinch, and your enemies find that while they might be able to disarm you, the real challenge is keeping you that way. Locked rooms, diabolical traps, and desperate situations are each their own sort of puzzle to you, and the mundane objects around you are the pieces you use to improvise your own solution. SCROUNGER DEDICATION FEAT 2 UNCOMMON ARCHETYPE DEDICATION Prerequisites trained in {@skill Crafting} You can {@action Craft} items even without appropriate tools or a workshop, though you take a\u20132 item penalty to your {@skill Crafting} check. Additionally, you don't need a physical formula book to remember all of your formulas; you pay the same cost as normal to learn them, but you memorize them all. You can {@action Craft} temporary items out of anything, anywhere, with whatever materials happen to be on hand, spending only 10 minutes to perform the initial {@skill Crafting} check. The temporary item must be common, non-magical, 1st level or lower, and must be a weapon, armor, or a nonconsumable piece of adventuring gear (nonconsumable adventuring gear appears on Table 6\u20139 on page 288 of the Core Rulebook). Instead of a single item, you can create 10 pieces of a single type of ammunition. This is a shoddy item, but you don't take the normal penalty when using shoddy items you made using this feat. Your temporary item lasts for {@dice 1d4} hours before falling apart into its raw components; the GM rolls the number of hours secretly. You can create only the physical item, not any information or magic, so for example, while you could create a blank journal or one of random pages, you couldn't use it as a scholarly journal or a religious text. You can incorporate any materials or items that you have on hand, even if they're not the type of materials that would ordinarily be used to {@action Craft} a given item, though you must have enough volume of material to make the item you want. Unless all the materials you used were an appropriate type to make the item, you take a\u20135 penalty to the {@skill Crafting} check (or a\u201310 penalty if the materials you used were particularly unsuitable, as determined by the GM). Special You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the scrounger archetype. REVERSE ENGINEERING FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE SKILL Prerequisites expert in {@skill Crafting}, Scrounger Dedication You are able to reverse engineer items into formulas more effectively than most. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to {@skill Crafting} checks to reverse engineer a formula from an item. Additionally, if you get a critical success on your {@skill Crafting} check, you can opt to not only create the formula but also reassemble the original item at the same time, leaving you with the formula and the item instead of the formula and raw materials equal to half the item's value. HIGH-QUALITY SCROUNGER FEAT 6 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Scrounger Dedication When you {@action Craft} a temporary item using Scrounger Dedication, it can be an item of up to 3rd level (though the item must still be a weapon, armor, or a nonconsumable piece of adventuring gear). You can instead {@action Craft} it for someone else's use, allowing them to avoid taking the penalty for using a shoddy item when using it, but causing you to take the penalty if you use it. EXPERT DISASSEMBLY FEAT 7 ARCHETYPE SKILL Prerequisites master in {@skill Crafting}, Scrounger Dedication You can apply the same techniques you use to reverse engineer objects to disable them. You can use {@skill Crafting} instead of {@skill Thievery} to {@action Disable a Device} or {@action Pick a Lock}. Sentinel Armor offers solid, reassuring protection in combat, and as someone who faces danger on a regular basis, you have made it your business to get the most out of your defenses. You stand solid on any battlefield, encased in the sturdiest armor you can find. When danger threatens, your solid defenses will safely get you, and possibly your companions, home again. As a sentinel, you might be a member of an order of knights or bodyguards that trained you how best to take advantage of heavy armor. On the other hand, you might just be an adventurer who took one too many scrapes and decided that enough was enough, so you trained yourself to wear the heaviest plate you could get your hands on. Some witches or sorcerers have chosen to follow the path of the sentinel to increase their survivability. Additional Feats: 10th Sacrifice Armor (page 120); 16th Greater Interpose (page 121) SENTINEL DEDICATION FEAT 2 ARCHETYPE DEDICATION You have trained carefully to maximize the protective qualities of your armor. You become trained in light armor and medium armor. If you already were trained in light armor and medium armor, you gain training in heavy armor as well. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in any type of armor (but not unarmored defense), you also gain that proficiency in the armor types granted to you by this feat. If you are at least 13th level and you have a class feature that grants you expert proficiency in unarmored defense, you also become an expert in the armor types granted to you by this feat. Special You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the sentinel archetype. STEEL SKIN FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE SKILL Prerequisites trained in {@skill Survival}, Sentinel Dedication You wear your armor like a second skin. You can rest normally while wearing medium armor. If you are a master in heavy armor, you can also rest normally while wearing heavy armor. ARMOR SPECIALIST FEAT 6 ARCHETYPE SKILL Prerequisites Sentinel Dedication You have trained hard to optimize your armor's protective qualities. You gain the armor specialization effects of medium and heavy armor. ARMORED REBUFF {@as R} FEAT 8 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Sentinel Dedication Trigger An adjacent foe critically fails an attack roll to {@action Strike} you with a melee weapon or unarmed attack. Requirements You are wearing medium armor or heavier. You rebuff puny attacks with your armor, knocking back your foe. Attempt an {@skill Athletics} check to {@action Shove} the triggering foe, even if you don't have a hand free. If you succeed, you can't {@action Stride} to follow the foe, as you're knocking the foe back with the rebounded attack, not by physically moving towards them. MIGHTY BULWARK FEAT 10 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Sentinel Dedication Thanks to your incredible connection to your armor, you can use it to shrug off an incredible array of dangers. Your bonus from the bulwark armor trait increases from +3 to +4, and it applies on all Reflex saves, not just damaging Reflex saves. ADDITIONAL SHADOW MAGIC FEAT 12 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Shadow Magic Choose an additional shadowdancer focus spell you haven't already selected from Shadow Magic. Increase the number of Focus Points in your pool by 1. SHADOW ILLUSION FEAT 12 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Shadow Magic With an artful eye, you shape shadows into illusory forms. You gain the shadow illusion (page 191) focus spell. Increase the number of Focus Points in your pool by 1. You become an expert in occult spell attack rolls and DCs. SHADOW POWER FEAT 14 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Shadow Magic You can focus the shadows into a powerful blast. You can cast {@spell shadow blast} (Core Rulebook 367) as an innate occult spell once per day. Its level is always 1 level lower than the level of your shadowdancer focus spells. You become an expert in occult spell attack rolls and DCs. SHADOW MASTER FEAT 18 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Shadowdancer Dedication The shadows protect you better than any armor can, and they give you power to plunge others into darkness. Whenever you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you gain resistance 5 to all damage except force and damage from Strikes with the Shadowdancer Shadow has always been the cousin of fear. Within the darkness, monsters dwell, plans are hatched, and enemies strike with fang and dagger and dark magic. But some embrace the shadow, gain power from it, and dance within its shifting dark. A true shadowdancer is a creature who flits on the edge of light and darkness. Moving amid the inky blackness, shadowdancers are spies, assassins, infiltrators, and emissaries. Some shadowdancers use their relationship with the dark for good, while others embrace the primordial night, its terror, and its betrayal. Regardless of the reason why someone embraces the shadows, the shadows embrace that person in turn, gradually transforming them into something inky, nebulous, and mysterious. Additional Feats: 10th Uncanny Dodge (Core Rulebook 229); 14th Spring from the Shadows (Core Rulebook 188); 16th Sense the Unseen (Core Rulebook 188); 18th Cognitive Loophole (Core Rulebook 188) SHADOWDANCER DEDICATION FEAT 8 ARCHETYPE DEDICATION Prerequisites master in {@skill Stealth}, expert in {@skill Performance} You dedicate yourself to the shadows. Your coloring becomes gray and gloomy, your senses adjust to the darkness, and you can sneak through darkness with ease. You gain greater darkvision. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to {@skill Stealth} checks when you are within dim light or darkness. Special You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the shadowdancer archetype. SHADOW SNEAK ATTACK FEAT 10 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Shadowdancer Dedication You gain the sneak attack class feature (Core Rulebook 181), except you deal {@damage 1d6} precision damage regardless of your level. {@action Sneak} attack from multiple sources isn't cumulative. If you have sneak attack from more than one source, use only the highest number of dice when you sneak attack rather than adding the amounts together. SHADOW MAGIC FEAT 10 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Shadowdancer Dedication You gain the ability to fuse and play with shadows by using focus spells specific to shadowdancers. You learn a shadowdancer focus spell of your choice: dance of darkness (page 191) or shadow jump (page 191). If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can {@action Refocus} by meditating within an area of dim light or darkness. The rules for focus spells appear on page 300 of the Core Rulebook. Shadowdancer focus spells are occult spells. You become trained in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs, and your spellcasting ability for these spells is Charisma. CALL OF SHADOWS The shadows call out to a potential shadowdancer in a myriad of ways. Often it starts with fear\u2014fear of the dark, fear of enemies, or an underlying uncontrolled anxiety and the desire to gain power over the darkness. Many potential shadowdancers hear the shadows whisper in their heads. First dismissed as some perverse trick of the mind, the whispers can seem to ebb and wane, but a true calling becomes more lucid and more compelling. In some shadow-infused lands in the Pathfinder setting, particularly Nidal, Ustalav, and even Cheliax, organizations search for and recruit those called by the shadows, eager to transform them into spies and assassins. But the call can come to any creature anywhere. It's just a question of whether the creature heeds the call and forms a pact with the shadows. Though it is hard to convince many folks otherwise, given the fearsome reputations of shadowdancers working for dark powers and cabals, there is nothing intrinsically evil about embracing the shadows. Darkness is amoral but not without its champions for good and even law, though it is true that such shadowdancers are few and far between. ghost touch property rune. When you attempt a Reflex saving throw in an area of dim light or darkness, you can roll twice and take the higher result; this is a {@trait fortune} effect. SHADOWDANCER FOCUS SPELLS"

						"entry": "When you arrive at your destination, you can become {@condition invisible} until the end of your next turn or until you are no longer in an area of dim light or darkness, whichever comes first. The invisibility is an {@trait illusion} effect. Snarecrafter You're able to take ordinary materials and use them to create deadly snares, special traps that you can rig up quickly when the situation demands. While traps might grant you less brute force to apply in a fair fight than weapons would, you rarely allow your fights to be fair. Instead, when a battle takes place at a location of your choice, you have a major advantage thanks to your well-placed snares. Once your foes come to realize that you may have trapped any location on the battlefield, their fear of walking into another trap can help you corral them toward the waiting blades of your allies, or even make them too paranoid to move at all, locking them in place. Additional Feats: 8th Quick Snares (Core Rulebook 173); 10th Powerful Snares (Core Rulebook 174); 14th Lightning Snares (Core Rulebook 175) SNARECRAFTER DEDICATION FEAT 2 ARCHETYPE DEDICATION Prerequisites trained in {@skill Crafting}, Snare {@skill Crafting} You've learned to create a limited number of snares at no cost. Each day during your daily preparations, you can prepare four snares from your formula book for quick deployment; if they normally take 1 minute to {@action Craft}, you can {@action Craft} them with 3 {@action Interact} actions. The number of snares increases to six if you're a master in {@skill Crafting} and eight if you're legendary. Snares prepared in this way don't cost you any resources to {@action Craft}. Special The feat counts as Snare Specialist for the purpose of feat prerequisites. If you also have the Snare Specialist ranger feat, the quick snares from both feats are cumulative. You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the snarecrafter archetype. SURPRISE SNARE {@as 3} FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE MANIPULATION Prerequisites Snarecrafter Dedication You install one of your snares prepared for quick deployment in a space that's occupied by an opponent. It must be a snare that normally takes 1 minute or less to {@action Craft}. The snare automatically triggers, but it takes a\u20132 circumstance penalty to any applicable save DC, as well as any attack rolls or other checks the snare attempts. REMOTE TRIGGER FEAT 6 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Snarecrafter Dedication You've learned how to trigger snares from afar, creating ranged hazards to assail your opponents and allowing you to disarm enemies' snares harmlessly. You can {@action Strike} a snare to trigger it prematurely. If you crafted the snare, you automatically hit. If someone else crafted it, attempt a ranged {@action Strike} against the {@skill Crafting} DC, triggering the snare only if you hit. GIANT SNARE FEAT 10 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Snarecrafter Dedication You can create bigger snares for quick deployment, making it more likely for a creature to walk into your snares. When you prepare snares for quick deployment, you can prepare some of them as giant snares. A giant snare takes up a 10-foot-by-10-foot area but costs two of your quick deployment snares. A giant snare can trigger from a creature entering any portion of its area, and all its effects apply over the full area. PLENTIFUL SNARES FEAT 12 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Snarecrafter Dedication You can prepare incredible numbers of snares each day out of simple ingredients. Double the number of prepared snares granted by Snarecrafter Dedication. Talisman Dabbler The classic idea of magic is that of a hoary wizard, poring over a crumbling book of spells. But magic is so much more than that\u2014it is thought, will, and action, and with the right talismans, you can make even the cut of a sword a deeply magical act. This all hinges on the small magical talismans you affix to your gear. You know how to make and use the perfect talismans for any job. TALISMAN DABBLER DEDICATION FEAT 2 ARCHETYPE DEDICATION You are trained in the use of talismans and similar magical paraphernalia. This training might have occurred in a formal classroom or been an agglomeration of folk magic picked up over time. You can craft talismans and know the formulas for all common talismans in the Core Rulebook of your level or lower. You remember talisman formulas and don't need a formula book for them. Additionally, you carry a collection of magical baubles you can turn into temporary talismans. Each day during your daily preparations, you can make two talismans with an item level no higher than half your level. You must know each talisman's formula. A talisman created this way is a temporary item and loses its magic the next time you make your daily preparations if you haven't already used it. Finally, when you {@action Affix a Talisman}, you can (in any combination) affix or remove up to four talismans in the 10-minute span. Special You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the talisman dabbler archetype. QUICK FIX FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Talisman Dabbler Dedication You can attach a talisman using only a bit of glue and some string. You gain the Rapid Affixture skill feat (page 208), even if you don't meet the prerequisites. When you use it, you can affix or remove up to four talismans in 1 minute instead of just one. You gain the ability to {@action Affix a Talisman} as a 3-action activity from that feat at 12th level, regardless of your {@skill Crafting} proficiency. DEEPER DABBLER FEAT 8 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Talisman Dabbler Dedication With some streamlining to your process and a deeper collection of talisman materials, you make a greater number of talismans every day. You can create two additional talismans during your daily preparations. Special You can select this feat a second time if you are 14th level or higher. TALISMANIC SAGE FEAT 14 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Talisman Dabbler Dedication You have forgotten more about talismans than lesser warriors have ever known. Normally, affixing more than one talisman to an item causes the talismans to be suppressed, but when you {@action Affix a Talisman}, you can specially treat one item you're working on, allowing it to have two active talismans at once. This special treatment ends if you use {@action Affix a Talisman} to treat a new item for this ability. Vigilante As a vigilante, you have two faces: a public persona, and a secret identity that lets you hide your extralegal actions from polite society. Your secret identity lets you adventure and carry out clandestine missions while keeping the civilians you care about safe. Whatever your purpose\u2014fighting crime, inciting rebellion, sowing chaos\u2014your vigilante identity makes you both hard to pin down and a mysterious, intriguing subject of gossip. Additional Feats: 4th Quick Draw (Pathfinder Core Rulebook 172) VIGILANTE DEDICATION FEAT 2 UNCOMMON ARCHETYPE DEDICATION Prerequisites trained in {@skill Deception} You have two identities, each with its own name, alignment, and abilities. Your social identity is an upstanding member of society, while your vigilante identity is a skilled and cunning warrior. Neither of these identities is a false front; you really are both of these people, and as such, your two identities can be at most one alignment step from each other (for instance, you could be neutral in one identity and neutral evil in the other, but not chaotic evil in the other). If someone attempts to discern your other identity, they must use a {@action Seek} action to attempt a Perception check against your {@skill Deception} DC, as if you were using the {@action Impersonate} action. Your {@skill Deception} DC against such attempts is 20 + your proficiency modifier instead of the normal DC. Unlike with {@action Impersonate}, you don't have to attempt a {@skill Deception} check to interact with someone to conceal your other identity\u2014a check happens only if someone else specifically tries to uncover your other identity. Changing from one identity to the other takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures. As this process involves both physical changes such as clothing and makeup along with an altered state of mind, other effects that change your appearance don't reduce the time required to change identities. Your two identities are completely distinct. You have your current identity's alignment for effects that rely on alignment, though you are eligible for abilities that require a certain alignment (such as a cleric's deity) only if both of your identities qualify. Checks to {@action Recall Knowledge} about one of your identities don't reveal information about the other unless the person attempting the check knows both identities are the same person. Effects that detect you based on your identity, such as the {@spell detect alignment} spell, work only if you are currently in the identity the effect is trying to detect; otherwise, the effect fails as if the target didn't exist. To maintain the separation between your identities, some of your abilities have one of two traits: social or vigilante. You can use social feats only while in your social identity. Your class feats and vigilante feats are associated with your vigilante identity, and using them while in your social identity risks exposing you as a vigilante. This means that if you were particularly meek or inconspicuous before you took this feat, your identity could be at greater risk of exposure. If your identity is exposed to the public, you lose the benefits of Vigilante Dedication to disguising yourself, but you can otherwise use both social and vigilante abilities in either identity unless they rely on your identity being a secret. You can use feats that don't have either trait regardless of your current identity. Special You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the vigilante archetype. {@condition HIDDEN} MAGIC FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE SKILL Prerequisites expert in {@skill Arcana}, {@skill Nature}, {@skill Occultism}, or {@skill Religion}; Vigilante Dedication You've learned to hide the magical auras of your gear. During your daily preparations, you carefully tweak any or all of your magic items to appear non-magical. Objects adjusted in this way remain so until your next preparations. A spellcaster using detect magic or read aura must succeed at a Perception check against your {@skill Deception} DC to see through your obfuscations. MINION GUISE FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE SKILL SOCIAL Prerequisites animal companion or familiar, expert in {@skill Deception}, Vigilante Dedication When you are in your social identity, you can also grant a social identity to an animal companion, familiar, or other minion you gained from a class feature. When changing to your social identity, you also change your minion's appearance to that of a socially acceptable creature of its type, such as grooming a wolf to appear as a large dog or disguising a familiar to appear as an exotic pet. Commanding your minion to use unusual magical or combat abilities it gained from your class features or feats while in this social identity risks exposing your vigilante identity. SAFE HOUSE FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Vigilante Dedication You establish a safe house\u2014a secure space in which to hide your secrets from the outside world. This safe house is roughly the size of a 10-foot cube. It's in a location you have access to, and it can be part of a larger building or structure, like a {@condition hidden} room or an underground cave. The safe house protects objects and people inside it from magical detection. This has the effects of nondetection, using your {@skill Deception} modifier for the counteract DC and half your level rounded up for the counteract level. Setting up or moving your safe house takes a week of downtime. The size of the safe house expands to four 10-foot cubes if you're an expert in {@skill Deception}, eight cubes if you're a master, and 16 cubes if you're legendary. SOCIAL PURVIEW FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Vigilante Dedication You have built a reputation for yourself in your social identity. Choose one archetype that you meet the prerequisites for. You gain that archetype's dedication feat and can select feats from that archetype, even if you haven't yet gained enough feats in the vigilante archetype to take another dedication feat. These feats become part of your social identity and gain the social trait\u2014for instance, a fighter vigilante could take the wizard dedication feat and have a wizard social identity. Using these feats in your social identity doesn't risk exposing your vigilante identity, but using them in your vigilante identity could put you at risk for exposure. STARTLING APPEARANCE {@as 1} FEAT 6 ARCHETYPE EMOTION FEAR MENTAL VIGILANTE Prerequisites Vigilante Dedication Requirements You are completely {@condition unnoticed} by the target creature. You can startle foes who are unaware of your presence. Make a {@action Strike} against your target. That creature is {@condition flat-footed} against this {@action Strike}, as normal. If your {@action Strike} hits, the target remains {@condition flat-footed} for the rest of your turn and is {@condition frightened|CRB|frightened 1} ({@condition frightened|CRB|frightened 2} on a critical hit). QUICK CHANGE FEAT 7 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites master in {@skill Deception}, Vigilante Dedication You can shift between your identities with ease. Instead of spending 1 minute to change your identity, you can now do so as a 3-action activity. If you are legendary in {@skill Deception}, you can perform this change as a 1-action activity. SUBJECTIVE TRUTH FEAT 7 ARCHETYPE SKILL Prerequisites master in {@skill Deception}, Vigilante Dedication Your disparate identities allow you to defeat magic that detects lies. As long as what you say is true from the point of view of your current identity, you can say it even under effects like zone of truth that force you to speak the truth. MANY GUISES FEAT 8 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites master in {@skill Deception}, Vigilante Dedication You can take on any number of mundane guises. Whenever you change your identity, instead of taking on your social or vigilante identity, you can become someone completely ordinary. This identity isn't a specific individual\u2014rather, you become a nondescript member of your ancestry, of any gender, with a neutral alignment and a mundane occupation such as common laborer, farmer, or peasant. Spells and abilities detect you as if you were this ordinary identity, rather than either of your two real identities, unless they succeed at a counteract check against your {@skill Deception} DC. You can't use either social abilities or vigilante abilities while in this identity. FRIGHTENING APPEARANCE FEAT 12 ARCHETYPE VIGILANTE Prerequisites expert in {@skill Intimidation}, Startling Appearance Your dramatic appearances can frighten bystanders. When you make a Startling Appearance, you can also attempt to {@action Demoralize} each opponent within 10 feet to whom you were {@condition unnoticed} before your {@action Strike}. STUNNING APPEARANCE FEAT 16 ARCHETYPE VIGILANTE Prerequisites Startling Appearance Your sudden appearance leaves your foe unable to respond. When you use Startling Appearance, if your foe's level is equal to or lower than yours, they are also {@condition stunned|CRB|stunned 1} on a hit, or {@condition stunned|CRB|stunned 2} on a critical hit. Viking To go \"a-viking\" is to raid by sea, and thus vikings have spread far and wide. Some have even settled in the very communities they once raided. Vikings traditionally travel in longboats; a score of these warriors might live aboard their ship for days at a time, sailing the seas (or, as they call it, the \"whale-road\") to ambush coastal communities. Once they arrive at a settlement, they charge ashore, plundering all they can find and slaying anyone foolish enough to get in their way. The ferocity of viking raids is legendary. Additional Feats: 4th Reactive Shield (Core Rulebook 145); 6th Shielded {@action Stride} (Core Rulebook 146); 10th Quick Shield Block (Core Rulebook 149) VIKING DEDICATION FEAT 2 ARCHETYPE DEDICATION Prerequisites trained in {@skill Athletics} Vikings spend long periods of time at sea, only to leap from their boats at a moment's notice, charge through the surf, and take their enemies by storm. You're trained in {@skill Lore|Sailing Lore}. When moving through water using your land Speed, you ignore difficult terrain resulting from shallow water, such as in bogs or on beaches. In addition, if you roll a success for your {@skill Athletics} check to {@action Swim}, you get a critical success instead. Special You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the viking archetype. HURLING CHARGE {@as 2} FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Viking Dedication You make a ranged {@action Strike} with a thrown weapon you already have in your hand, {@action Stride}, and then {@action Interact} to draw another weapon. If you are raging, you can add the additional damage with melee weapons you receive from raging to your damage with the thrown weapon. VIKING WEAPON FAMILIARITY FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Viking Dedication From childhood, you have been exposed to traditional viking weapons, and you soon learned to handle them in battle. Now, you can raid proudly alongside your fellows. You are trained with the battle axe, hatchet, longsword, and shortsword. In addition, you gain the Shield Block reaction. VIKING WEAPON SPECIALIST FEAT 6 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Viking Weapon Familiarity You are even more skilled in the weapons of your people. You gain the critical specialization effects of the battle axe, hatchet, longsword, and shortsword. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in certain weapons, you also gain that proficiency rank in the above four weapons. SECOND SHIELD {@as F} FEAT 6 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Viking Dedication Trigger Your Shield Block causes your shield to break or be destroyed. You're used to your shield breaking in the middle of battle, and you're prepared to use a backup or any convenient nearby object to defend yourself. You can {@action Interact} to draw a shield on your person or an unattended shield within your reach. If there is an object within your reach that could serve as an improvised shield\u2014for example, a table or chair\u2014you can {@action Interact} to draw it with this feat. The GM determines if something can be used as an improvised shield. Your new shield isn't raised until you use the {@action Raise a Shield} action, as normal. Weapon Improviser As far as you're concerned, the best weapon to wield is the one that your opponents never see coming. By knowing how to fight effectively with whatever's at hand, you ensure that you're never caught unarmed, and you often get the drop on opponents who mistakenly think they've caught you off guard. Whether you're smashing someone over the head with a bar stool, tossing a mug of ale in their face to blind them, or stabbing your foes with a {@condition broken} bottle, you can find weapons anywhere and employ them creatively whenever a fight breaks out. Because you fight with disposable weapons, you don't need to be as careful with your weapons as other warriors do, and you can break them when needed to win a fight without feeling any regrets later. WEAPON IMPROVISER DEDICATION FEAT 2 ARCHETYPE DEDICATION Prerequisites trained in all martial weapons You don't take the normal\u20132 penalty to attack rolls with improvised weapons. Additionally, whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency with any weapon, you also gain that proficiency with improvised weapons. Special You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the weapon improviser archetype. IMPROVISED PUMMEL {@as 1} FEAT 4 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Weapon Improviser Dedication Requirements You are wielding an improvised weapon. You make a {@action Strike} with your wielded improvised weapon. You gain a +1 item bonus to the attack roll, and the {@action Strike} deals two weapon damage dice if it would have dealt fewer. If the attack is a critical hit, in addition to the effect of the critical hit, the improvised weapon breaks. If the item has a Hardness greater than your level, or if it's an artifact, cursed item, or other item that's difficult to break or destroy, the item doesn't break and the attack is a hit instead of a critical hit. At 12th level, your item bonus to the attack roll increases to +2 instead of +1, and at 16th level, the {@action Strike} deals three weapon damage dice if it would have dealt fewer, instead of two. SURPRISE STRIKE FEAT 6 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Weapon Improviser Dedication Whenever you make a {@action Strike} with an improvised weapon against a creature that hasn't seen you make a {@action Strike} using an improvised weapon or that is otherwise ignorant of your skill with improvised weapons, the creature is {@condition flat-footed} against you for that {@action Strike}. IMPROVISED CRITICAL FEAT 8 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Weapon Improviser Dedication You can apply critical specialization effects to improvised weapons you wield. For any given improvised weapon, the GM determines which critical specialization effect is most applicable, based on the type of object it is. MAKESHIFT STRIKE {@as 1} FEAT 8 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Weapon Improviser Dedication You quickly snatch up whatever's nearby and then attack with it as an improvised weapon. You {@action Interact} to pick up a nearby object you could use as an improvised weapon. It must be located at around your chest level, such as a mug on a table, rather than an object on the floor. You then either {@action Strike} or make an Improvised Pummel with the improvised weapon. SHATTERING STRIKE {@as R} FEAT 10 ARCHETYPE Prerequisites Improvised Pummel Trigger An improvised weapon that you are wielding becomes {@condition broken} as a result of a critical success on an Improvised Pummel. The improvised weapon shatters, destroying it completely but dealing an additional {@damage 3d6} piercing damage to the creature you hit with the Improvised Pummel. This extra damage you apply on the critical hit doesn't double from the critical hit, as normal."

REINCARNATE RITUAL 3 UNCOMMON NECROMANCY Cast 4 hours; Cost rare herbs worth a total value of the target's level (minimum 1) × 25 gp; Secondary Casters 2 Primary Check {@skill Nature} (expert); Secondary Checks {@skill Occultism}, {@skill Religion} Range 10 feet; Targets 1 dead creature of up to 8th level You call forth the target's soul and attempt to incarnate it into a brand-new body. As the soul won't be returning to the original body, only a small portion of the creature's remains are required. These remains must have been part of the original body at the time of death, and the target must have died within the past week. If Pharasma has decided that the target's time has come or the target's soul is trapped or doesn't wish to return, this ritual automatically fails, but you discover this after you succeed at the {@skill Religion} check and can end the ritual without paying the cost. If the ritual is successful, the target's new body has a random ancestry. First roll {@dice 1d20}. On a result of 1 through 14, the new body is one of a common ancestry, while on a 15 through 20 they become a member of an uncommon or rare ancestry. The GM chooses possible ancestries based on those found in the region and then rolls randomly between them. For instance, the GM could roll {@dice 1d6} to choose a common ancestry from the Core Rulebook. The target replaces their ancestry Hit Points, size, Speeds, ability boosts, ability flaws, traits, and special abilities with those of their new ancestry. The target loses their heritage and ancestry feats, selecting replacements from their new ancestry. The target's background, class features, and known languages remain unaltered. Critical Success You reincarnate the target into a new adult body. This new body has full HP and has the same spells prepared and points in their pools as the original did when it died. Success As critical success, except the new body has 1 HP and no spells prepared or points in any pools. The soul takes some time to adjust to their new body, leaving them {@condition clumsy|CRB|clumsy 2}, {@condition drained|CRB|drained 2}, and {@condition enfeebled|CRB|enfeebled 2} for 1 week; these conditions can't be removed or reduced by any means until the week has passed. Failure You fail to reincarnate the target. Critical Failure The target's soul becomes trapped in an unintelligent animal creature of the GM's choosing, with a level no greater than half the target's level. While trapped, the target has an Intelligence score of 1 (\u20135 modifier) and can't use any of their own abilities. Heightened (4th) The maximum level of the target increases to 10. The cost is the target's level (minimum 1) × 40 gp. Heightened (5th) The maximum level of the target increases to 12. The cost is the target's level (minimum 1) × 75 gp. Heightened (6th) The maximum level of the target increases to 14. The cost is the target's level (minimum 1) × 125 gp. The target must have died within the past month. Heightened (7th) The maximum level of the target increases to 16. The cost is the target's level (minimum 1) × 200 gp. The target must have died within the past month. Heightened (8th) The maximum level of the target increases to 18. The cost is the target's level (minimum 1) × 300 gp. The target must have died within the past year. Heightened (9th) The maximum level of the target increases to 20. The cost is the target's level (minimum 1) × 600 gp. The target must have died within the past decade. REST ETERNAL RITUAL 4 UNCOMMON NECROMANCY Cast 1 day; Cost rare oils to anoint the body worth a total value of the target's level (minimum 1) × 25 gp; Secondary Casters 2 Primary Check {@skill Religion} (expert); Secondary Checks {@skill Occultism}, {@skill Religion} Range 20 feet; Targets 1 dead creature You call upon gods, spirits, and stranger beings to bar a creature's spirit from ever returning. A spirit that doesn't wish to be so constrained can attempt a Will save to resist this ritual; on a critical success, it fools you into believing the ritual succeeded. This ritual has no effect on a target who is undead or whose soul is otherwise not in the afterlife. Critical Success You sequester the subject's spirit to the afterlife. Attempts to communicate with the dead creature, return it to life, turn it into an undead, or otherwise disturb its afterlife fail unless the effect's counteract level is at least 2 higher than that of rest eternal or originates from an artifact or a deity. Successfully returning the creature to life ends the restrictions placed by rest eternal. Success As critical success, but effects to interact with the spirit fail unless the effect's counteract level is higher than that of rest eternal or originates from an artifact or a deity. Failure The ritual has no effect. Critical Failure The ritual fails, and the spirits you appealed to are angered by your meddling. All casters become {@condition doomed|CRB|doomed 1} for 1 week. SIMULACRUM RITUAL 4 RARE ILLUSION Cast 1 day; Cost a piece of hair, drop of blood, or other part of the creature to be duplicated, plus rare oils, minerals, and pigments with a total value of 300 gp; Secondary Casters 3 Primary Check {@skill Arcana} or {@skill Occultism} (master, the check has the {@trait secret} trait); Secondary Checks {@skill Arcana}, {@skill Nature}, {@skill Occultism}, {@skill Religion}, or {@skill Society} (whichever is required to {@action Recall Knowledge} about the creature being duplicated); {@skill Crafting}; {@skill Deception} Targets 1 living creature You create an illusory duplicate of the target creature by animating ice or snow sculpted in its shape. The simulacrum is a 4th-level creature with no special abilities. If it needs to attempt a roll or use a DC, use the moderate number for a monster (Gamemastery Guide 57), except as noted below. It doesn't have any specific memories from the target, but it can use information about the creature gained from any of the casters to {@action Impersonate} the target. It looks exactly like the target and has a {@skill Deception} modifier to {@action Impersonate} that creature equal to the modifier of the secondary spellcaster who rolled the {@skill Deception} check, with a +4 status bonus. While it doesn't have any of the original's special abilities, like a dragon's breath weapon, the illusions that make up the simulacrum allow it to appear to use those abilities; they just never seem to have an effect. For instance, against a simulacrum dragon's breath weapon, all creatures in the area seem to critically succeed at their saving throws and take no damage. Creatures can attempt to disbelieve the illusion by attempting a Perception check against the {@skill Deception} DC of the secondary spellcaster who rolled the {@skill Deception} check. Critical Success You bring the simulacrum to life. It has the minion trait and is under your absolute control. You gain a direct mental link with the simulacrum and can spend an action to command the simulacrum via this link, even at a distance. Success As a critical success, but there is no special link between you and the simulacrum. You must spend an action to command it verbally or by some other means. Failure The ritual fails and has no effect. Critical Failure The simulacrum awakens, but it isn't your minion and is {@condition hostile} to all the casters. It does everything it can to destroy them, but if it can't immediately slay them, the simulacrum tries to escape and plots their demise. TELEPORTATION CIRCLE RITUAL 7 UNCOMMON CONJURATION TELEPORTATION Cast 1 day; Cost rare incense, precious metals, and purified chalk worth 500 gp; Secondary Casters 2 Primary Check {@skill Arcana} or {@skill Occultism} (master); Secondary Checks {@skill Crafting}, {@skill Survival} Range 20 feet Duration 1 day You create a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground, which acts as a portal to a destination determined at the time of the ritual. You designate the destination of the teleportation as part of the ritual. This destination can't be changed. The destination must be a location within 1,000 miles and be on the same plane as the teleportation circle. You must be able to identify the location precisely both by its position relative to the location where you create the teleportation circle and by the destination's appearance (or other identifying features). The destination must also be a 10-foot-diameter circle that doesn't overlap with any solid structures, but it can be a place that is harmful or dangerous. A secondary caster attempting a {@skill Survival} check for this ritual can be located at the exact site of the destination, instead of with you at the point of origin. If the secondary succeeds at their check at the destination and you roll a success, the ritual is a critical success instead. While the circle is active, any creature that moves to be fully within the circle is instantly teleported to the destination. A creature that is unwilling to be teleported can attempt a Will save to resist the effect. If it remains in the circle, the creature must attempt this save again at the end of each of its turns. The teleportation circle normally goes only in one direction, though you can double the Cost to make the teleportation work in both directions. Critical Success You create the teleportation circle, and it's extremely precise, regardless of the distance traveled. Travelers arrive exactly at the designated point. Success As a critical success, but the destination of the teleportation circle is slightly inaccurate, and is off target by roughly 1 percent of the distance traveled, to a maximum of 10 miles off target. Failure The teleportation circle doesn't function. Critical Failure The teleportation circle is wildly inaccurate. It leads to a random destination roughly the same distance from the origin point, and the chances of some other unusual mishap are much greater. Heightened (9th) The cost increases to 2,000 gp, the duration increases to 1 month, and the destination can be anywhere on the same planet. Heightened (10th) The cost increases to 10,000 gp, the duration is unlimited, and the destination can be anywhere on the same planet. UNSEEN CUSTODIANS RITUAL 3 UNCOMMON CONJURATION Cast 1 day; Cost rare oils, salts, and herbs worth a total value of 15 gp; Secondary Casters 2 Primary Check {@skill Arcana} or {@skill Occultism} (expert); Secondary Checks {@skill Arcana} or {@skill Occultism} (whichever isn't used for the primary check), {@skill Diplomacy} Area 100 feet × 100 feet, up to 20 feet high Duration 1 year You create a site-bound, long-lasting {@spell unseen servant} spell effect, forming entities of pure force to carry out basic tasks at a fixed location. Critical Success The ritual creates six unseen servants (Core Rulebook 380). You don't need to concentrate on them, and they aren't summoned minions. You can spend an action, which has the {@trait concentrate} trait, to command one to perform a basic task; it continues to perform the task until commanded again. Success As critical success, but the ritual creates three unseen servants. Failure The ritual fails to create any servants. Critical Failure The ritual creates six unseen servants, but these creatures are {@condition hostile} and capable of making fist Strikes with an attack bonus equal to your skill modifier for the primary skill check, dealing {@damage 1d6} force damage. They attack you and your allies and attempt to break objects belonging to you and your allies within the area. Heightened (6th) If destroyed, the unseen servants reform the next morning. The cost increases to 30 gp. WARD DOMAIN RITUAL 6 UNCOMMON ABJURATION Cast 1 day; Cost rare incenses, oils, and powdered silver, worth 150 gp total; Secondary Casters 3 Primary Check {@skill Arcana}, {@skill Nature}, or {@skill Occultism} (master); {@skill Lore|Secondary Checks Lore} (any), {@skill Survival}, {@skill Thievery} Area 100 feet × 100 feet, up to 50 feet high Duration 1 week This ritual has long been used to guard the private sanctums of powerful rulers, spellcasters, and other figures of import. You and the other casters spend the casting time burning incense, anointing doorframes, and drawing lines of powered silver across entryways. The ritual creates the following {@trait magical} effects within the area; these effects are heightened to the level of ward domain and remain throughout the duration. All gates, doors, windows, and similar apertures in the area (if any) are locked, with the effects of lock. In addition, you can obscure up to six doors, doorways, or similar entrances within the area with the effects of illusory object to appear as plain walls. {@spell Scrying} spells can't perceive any stimuli from the area, and ward domain attempts to counteract {@trait teleportation} effects into or out of the area, including attempts to summon creatures into the area, using a modifier equal to the ritual's save DC\u201310. A successful dispel magic used on a specific effect removes only that effect (such as the lock effect on one window). A successful disjunction ends the entire ritual. Critical Success You create the effects described above, and you protect an area twice as large. Success You create the effects described above. Failure The ritual has no effect. Critical Failure The area becomes trapped and {@condition hostile} to you and your allies in a way you didn't anticipate. Heightened (+1) The ward covers an additional area 100 feet × 100 feet, up to 50 feet high, which must be contiguous with the original area. WORD OF RECALL RITUAL 7 RARE CONJURATION TELEPORTATION Cast 7 days; Cost rare oils and powdered minerals worth 5,000 gp; Secondary Casters 2 Primary Check {@skill Arcana} or {@skill Occultism} (expert, the check has the {@trait secret} trait); Secondary Checks {@skill Arcana} or {@skill Occultism} (whichever isn't used for the primary check), {@skill Society} Range 20 feet; Targets Up to seven willing creatures of 14th level or lower Duration 1 year You bind yourself and your allies to the specific safe location where you perform the ritual. This allows the participants to return later by simply speaking a word. Success You form the connection with the designated sanctuary. Any participant in the ritual can spend a single action, which has the {@trait concentrate} trait, to utter a word of power you choose when you cast the spell. When they do, all the participants can immediately return to the sanctuary from any distance, as long as they are on the same plane as the sanctuary. Each participant arrives in the position in which they were standing during the casting of the ritual. When the word is spoken, all other participants know it, and each can choose whether or not to return to the sanctuary at that time. The ritual then immediately ends. Failure You fail to form the connection between the participants and the sanctuary and are aware that the ritual has failed. Critical Failure The ritual inadvertently forms a connection with a location on another plane. The casters are unaware of this misalignment. When the word is invoked, all ritual participants are shifted to this extraplanar location. Heightened (+1) The cost increases by 5,000 gp, the ritual can target one more creature, and the maximum level of creature it can target increases by 2."

FANTASTIC FACADE RITUAL 9 RARE ILLUSION Cast 1 week; Cost mystical paint, elaborate veils, and powdered minerals worth 20,000 gp total; Secondary Casters 3 Primary Check {@skill Arcana} or {@skill Occultism} (legendary); Secondary Checks {@skill Society} or {@skill Survival}; {@skill Deception}; {@skill Stealth} Area circle centered on you up to 1 mile in radius; Targets 1 settlement and its residents Duration unlimited You draw a permanent series of complex illusions over the target settlement, choosing the look, sound, feel, and smell of the structures, terrain, and creatures within at the time the ritual is cast. You can alter the appearance of existing structures and creatures, and you can add illusory structures or creatures. For example, you could cause everything and everyone in the target area to appear green, create an illusory forest with a thick canopy that obscures the settlement from outside view, or make empty ruins seem inhabited and pristine. When you create the facade, you determine which illusory elements remain static (limited to basic natural movement, such as flags blowing in the breeze) and which follow a basic program (for example, a daily parade in the town square, complete with marching band). You're unable to alter the programs after you create the facade. You can disguise creatures as you please, with the same effects as a 3rd-level {@spell illusory disguise}. If a creature affected by the facade leaves the area, any illusions affecting it fade after 1 day. You decide when casting the ritual whether newcomers are disguised by the illusions, and whether the disguise appears immediately or after a set period, up to 1 week. A creature that interacts with the target settlement in a way that would suggest or reveal the illusory nature of the facade, such as by trying to paint a building affected by the facade or climbing an illusory structure, can attempt to disbelieve the illusion. The illusions created by the spell are harmless, so an illusory river of lava wouldn't cause damage, nor could thorns on an illusory rose bush prick someone. Critical Success You create the facade as described, and you can alter the programs within your facade by spending 1 day to reprogram them. Success You create the facade as described. Failure Your illusions fail and the ritual has no effect. Critical Failure Your ritual produces unexpected and uncontrolled illusions different from what you had planned, such as unexpected and slowly shifting colors across the buildings, unpleasant smells, and creatures appearing as skeletons. These effects fade after 1 month."

As part of the ritual, both members of the bond receive a ring, amulet, or similar token to symbolize their shared connection. They lose the effects of the ritual when not wearing the token, and the bond is {@condition broken} if either token is destroyed. Creatures benefiting from a successful heartbond ritual can later participate in a heightened version of the ritual without requiring new checks by spending the required time and paying the difference of the two costs. A creature can be under the effects of multiple heartbond rituals at once. Critical Success Once per day, each bonded creature can use a 2-action activity, which has the {@trait concentrate} trait, to learn the present state of the other bonded creature. The creature knows the other creature's direction and distance and any conditions affecting them. Both of the participants can cast {@spell message} as a divine innate spell at will, but can only target the other participant. Success As a critical success, except the bonded creatures can't cast {@spell message} as a divine innate spell. Failure The ritual has no effect.

HEROES' FEAST RITUAL 5 UNCOMMON CONJURATION Cast 4 hours; Cost 25 gp; Secondary Casters 1 Primary Check {@skill Nature}, {@skill Religion}, or {@skill Occultism} (expert); Secondary Checks {@skill Diplomacy} or {@skill Society} Range 40 feet You conjure otherworldly beings to serve you and your companions a feast with restorative properties. These mysterious beings may be fey, divine, or other supernatural servitors, as appropriate for the primary check. After the first hour of the ritual, these servants appear and serve a massive feast, complete with an exquisite table and up to 10 place settings. The bounteous spread consists of all manner of dishes, including the guests' childhood comfort foods, modern delicacies, and preferred drinks. The summoned servants spend the next 3 hours waiting on you and the other guests, fetching additional food, pouring drinks, and so forth. During this time, you and the other guests must strive to be as polite and gracious as possible to avoid offending your mysterious hosts. At the feast's end, the ritual is completed and you and the secondary caster attempt your checks as normal. If the feast is interrupted at any point, the servants immediately vanish with their provisions and the ritual is disrupted. Critical Success The feast is nourishing and revitalizing. The magical food casts neutralize poison, remove disease, and remove fear on each guest for each relevant affliction, using your modifier for the primary skill check as the counteract modifier. Each guest also recovers 100 Hit Points and gains 20 temporary Hit Points for the next 12 hours. Guests also gain a +2 status bonus to saves against disease, {@trait fear}, and {@trait poison} effects for the next 12 hours. Success As critical success, except guests recover only 50 Hit Points, gain only 10 temporary Hit Points, and don't gain the status bonus to saves. Failure You and the other guests taste ash in your mouths and realize that the feast contained nothing of sustenance. Critical Failure The otherworldly servants were offended by your behavior or the hubris you demonstrated in summoning them and poisoned the feast. You and your guests become {@condition sickened|CRB|sickened 4} and can't reduce the condition for 12 hours. Heightened (+1) Increase the Hit Points recovered by 10 and the temporary Hit Points by 2 (or twice each amount on a critical success). REINCARNATE RITUAL 3 UNCOMMON NECROMANCY Cast 4 hours; Cost rare herbs worth a total value of the target's level (minimum 1) × 25 gp; Secondary Casters 2 Primary Check {@skill Nature} (expert); Secondary Checks {@skill Occultism}, {@skill Religion} Range 10 feet; Targets 1 dead creature of up to 8th level You call forth the target's soul and attempt to incarnate it into a brand-new body. As the soul won't be returning to the original body, only a small portion of the creature's remains are required. These remains must have been part of the original body at the time of death, and the target must have died within the past week. If Pharasma has decided that the target's time has come or the target's soul is trapped or doesn't wish to return, this ritual automatically fails, but you discover this after you succeed at the {@skill Religion} check and can end the ritual without paying the cost. If the ritual is successful, the target's new body has a random ancestry. First roll {@dice 1d20}. On a result of 1 through 14, the new body is one of a common ancestry, while on a 15 through 20 they become a member of an uncommon or rare ancestry. The GM chooses possible ancestries based on those found in the region and then rolls randomly between them. For instance, the GM could roll {@dice 1d6} to choose a common ancestry from the Core Rulebook. The target replaces their ancestry Hit Points, size, Speeds, ability boosts, ability flaws, traits, and special abilities with those of their new ancestry. The target loses their heritage and ancestry feats, selecting replacements from their new ancestry. The target's background, class features, and known languages remain unaltered. Critical Success You reincarnate the target into a new adult body. This new body has full HP and has the same spells prepared and points in their pools as the original did when it died. Success As critical success, except the new body has 1 HP and no spells prepared or points in any pools. The soul takes some time to adjust to their new body, leaving them {@condition clumsy|CRB|clumsy 2}, {@condition drained|CRB|drained 2}, and {@condition enfeebled|CRB|enfeebled 2} for 1 week; these conditions can't be removed or reduced by any means until the week has passed. Failure You fail to reincarnate the target. Critical Failure The target's soul becomes trapped in an unintelligent animal creature of the GM's choosing, with a level no greater than half the target's level. While trapped, the target has an Intelligence score of 1 (\u20135 modifier) and can't use any of their own abilities."

A spirit that doesn't wish to be so constrained can attempt a Will save to resist this ritual; on a critical success, it fools you into believing the ritual succeeded. This ritual has no effect on a target who is undead or whose soul is otherwise not in the afterlife. Critical Success You sequester the subject's spirit to the afterlife. Attempts to communicate with the dead creature, return it to life, turn it into an undead, or otherwise disturb its afterlife fail unless the effect's counteract level is at least 2 higher than that of rest eternal or originates from an artifact or a deity. Successfully returning the creature to life ends the restrictions placed by rest eternal. Success As critical success, but effects to interact with the spirit fail unless the effect's counteract level is higher than that of rest eternal or originates from an artifact or a deity.
