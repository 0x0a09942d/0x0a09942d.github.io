For example, if you can't see {@condition invisible} creatures, the depiction doesn't reveal them even to a reader who could normally see them; a reader can't use their {@skill Perception} to notice details you missed, but they can attempt a check to {@action Recall Knowledge} based on what they just experienced if they have knowledge that you lack. You can have multiple scrolls from transcribe moment in existence at the same time, up to a number equal to your Intelligence modifier. If you Cast the Spell again while already at the maximum number of scrolls, choose one of the current scrolls to lose its magic, then create the new one."
